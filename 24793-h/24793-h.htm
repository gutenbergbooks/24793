      I ~ CAPTAIN BOYD MAYO GETS OUT OF SOUNDINGS
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     When in safety or in doubt,
     Always keep a safe lookout;
     Strive to keep a level head,
     Mind your lights and mind your lead.
                    &mdash;Pilot-house Ditty.
</pre>
    <p>
      For days he had been afraid of that incredible madness of his as a man
      fears a nameless monster. But he was sure of his strength even while
      admitting his weakness. He was confident that he had the thing securely in
      leash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then all at once it happened!
    </p>
    <p>
      Without preface of word or look he whirled and faced her, swept her into
      his arms and kissed her. He did not attempt to absolve himself or mitigate
      his offense by telling her that he loved her. He was voiceless&mdash;he
      could not control his speech. He did not dare to show such presumption as
      talk of love must seem to be to her. He knew he must not speak of love;
      such proffer to her would be lunacy. But this greater presumption, this
      blind capture of her in his arms&mdash;this was something which he had not
      intended any more than a sane man considers flight to the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not understand; he had been himself&mdash;then, instantly, in time
      measured by a finger-snap, he had become this wretch who seemed to be
      somebody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had ceased, for an insane moment, to be master of all his senses. But
      he released her as suddenly as he had seized her, and staggered to the
      door of the chart-room, turning his back on her and groaning in supreme
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that moment of delirium he had insulted his own New England sense of
      decency and honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was afraid to look back at her. With an agony of apprehension he
      dreaded the sound of her voice. He knew well enough that she was striving
      to get command of herself, to recover from her utter amazement. He waited.
      The outrage must have incensed her beyond measure; the silence was
      prolonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the yacht's saloon below a violin sang its very soul out upon the
      summer night, weaving its plaint into the soft, adagio rippling of a
      piano's chords.
    </p>
    <p>
      He searched his soul. The music, that distant, mellow phrasing of the call
      of love, the music had unstrung him. While he paced the bridge before her
      coming that music had been melting the ice of his natural reserve. But he
      did not pardon himself because he had acted the fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at the night framed in the door of the chart-house. Little waves
      were racing toward him, straight from the moon, on the sea-line, like a
      flood of new silver pouring from the open door of plenty!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the appealing beauty of that night could not excuse the unconscionable
      insult he had just offered her. He knew it, and shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had come and leaned close to him over the outspread chart, her breath
      on his cheek&mdash;so close to him that a roving tress of her hair flicked
      him. But because a sudden fire had leaped from the touch to his brain was
      no reason for the act by which he had just damned himself as a
      presumptuous brute.
    </p>
    <p>
      For he, Boyd Mayo, captain of her father's yacht, a hireling, had just
      paid the same insulting courtship to Alma Marston that a sailor would
      proffer to an ogling girl on the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll jump overboard,&rdquo; he stammered at last. &ldquo;I'll take myself out of your
      sight forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ominous silence persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't ask you to forgive me. It is not a thing which can be forgiven.
      Tell them I was insane&mdash;and jumped overboard. That will be the truth.
      I am a lunatic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lurched through the door. In that desperate moment, in the whirl of his
      emotions, there seemed to be no other way out of his horrible predicament.
      He had grown to love the girl with all the consuming passion of his soul,
      realizing fully his blind folly at the same time. He had built no false
      hopes. As to speaking of that love&mdash;even betraying it by a glance&mdash;he
      had sheathed himself in the armor of reserved constraint; he had been sure
      that he sooner would have gone down on his hands and knees and bayed that
      silver moon from the deck of the yacht <i>Olenia</i> than do what he had
      just done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Mayo! Wait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited without turning to look at her. Her voice was not steady, but he
      could not determine from the tone what her emotions were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was obliged to repeat the command with sharper authority before he
      obeyed. He lowered his eyes and stood before her, a voiceless suppliant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo; she asked. It was not the contemptuous demand which
      he had been fearing. Her voice was so low that it was almost a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; he confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The violin sang on; the moon shone in at the door; two strokes, like
      golden globules of sound, from the ship's bell signaled nine o'clock. Only
      the rhythm of the engines, as soothing as a cat's purring, and the slow
      roll of the yacht and the murmuring of the parted waves revealed that the
      <i>Olenia</i> was on her way through the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;It doesn't excuse me to say that I could not
      help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he understood women so little that he did not realize that he was
      making the ages-old plea which has softened feminine rancor ever since the
      Sabine women were borne away in their captors' arms and forgave their
      captors.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him, making once more a maiden's swift appraisal of this
      young man who had offered himself so humbly as a sacrifice. His brown
      hands were crossed in front of him and clutched convulsively his white
      cap. The cap and the linen above the collar of his uniform coat brought
      out to the full the hue of his manly tan. The red flush of his shocked
      contrition touched his cheeks, and, all in all, whatever the daughter of
      Julius Marston, Wall Street priest of high finance, may have thought of
      his effrontery, the melting look she gave him from under lowered eyelids
      indicated her appreciation of his outward excellencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are thoroughly and properly ashamed of what you have done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ashamed&mdash;so ashamed that I shall never dare to raise my eyes to
      you again. I will do what I promised. I will jump overboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Mayo, look at me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he obeyed, with the demeanor of a whipped hound, his perturbation
      would not allow him to show as much appreciation of her as she had
      displayed in the secret study of him, which she now promptly concealed. He
      surveyed her wistfully, with fear. And a maiden, after she has understood
      that she has obtained mastery over brawn and soul, does not care to be
      looked at as if she were Medusa.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stole a side-glance at her face in one of the mirrors, and then tucked
      into place a vagrant lock of hair with a shapely finger, thereby
      suggesting, had there been a cynical observer present, that Miss Alma
      Marston never allowed any situation, no matter how crucial, to take her
      attention wholly from herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no mistaking it&mdash;had that cynical observer been there, he
      would have noted that she pouted slightly when Mayo declared his
      unutterable shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never get over that shame, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Captain Mayo, feverishly anxious to show that he understood the
      enormity of his offense, and desiring to offer pledge for the future,
      declared that his shame would never lessen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her dark eyes sparkled; whether there was mischief mingled with
      resentment, or whether the resentment quite supplanted all other emotions,
      might have been a difficult problem for the cynic. But when she tilted her
      chin and stared the offender full in the eyes, propping her plump little
      hands in the side-pockets of her white reefer, Captain Mayo, like a man
      hit by a cudgel, was struck with the sudden and bewildering knowledge that
      he did not know much about women, for she asked, with a quizzical drawl,
      &ldquo;Just what is there about me, dear captain, to inspire that everlasting
      regret which seems to be troubling you so much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even then he did not grasp the full import of her provocative question.
      &ldquo;It isn't you. I'm the one who is wholly to blame,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I have
      dared to&mdash;But no matter. I know my place. I'll show you I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>dared</i> to&mdash;What have you dared to do&mdash;besides what
      you just did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you, Miss Marston. I don't propose to insult you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I command you to tell me, Captain Mayo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not comprehend her mood in the least and his demeanor showed it.
      Her command had a funny little ripple in it&mdash;as of laughter
      suppressed. There were queer quirks at the corners of her full, red lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now straighten up like your real self! I don't like to see you standing
      that way. You know I like to have all the folks on the yachts look at our
      captain when we go into a harbor! You didn't know it? Well, I do. Now what
      have you dared to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did straighten then. &ldquo;I have dared to fall in love with you, Miss
      Marston. So have a lot of other fools, I suppose. But I am the worst of
      all. I am only a sailor. How I lost control of myself I don't know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even now?&rdquo; Still that unexplainable softness in her voice, that
      strange expression on her face. Being a sailor, he looked on this calm as
      being ominous presage of a storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am willing to have you report me to your father, Miss Marston. I will
      take my punishment. I will never offend you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can control yourself after this, can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Marston, absolutely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated; she smiled. She lowered her eyelids again and surveyed him
      with the satisfied tolerance a pretty woman can so easily extend when
      unconquerable ardor has prompted to rashness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you funny, prim Yankee!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;You don't understand even now
      just why you did it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face revealed that he did not in the least understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; she invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went three steps across the narrow cabin and stood in an attitude of
      respectful obedience before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What now, sir?&rdquo; It was query even more provocative&mdash;a smile went
      with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I apologize. I have learned my lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need to learn a lot&mdash;you are very ignorant,&rdquo; she replied, with
      considerable tartness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he agreed, humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happened then was so wholly outside his reckoning that the preceding
      events of the evening retired tamely into the background. It had been
      conceivable that rush of passion might drive him to break all the rules of
      conduct his New England conscience had set over him; but what Alma Marston
      did overwhelmed him with such stupefaction that he stood there as rigid
      and motionless as a belaying-pin in a rack. She put up her arms, pressed
      her two hands on his shoulders, stood on tiptoe, and kissed him on his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, foolish old Yankee,&rdquo; she said, softly, her mouth close to his;
      &ldquo;since you are so ashamed I give you back your kiss&mdash;and all is made
      right between us, because we are just where we started a little while
      ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His amazement had so benumbed him that even after that surrender he stood
      there, close to her, his countenance blank, his arms dangling at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth is the matter with you?&rdquo; she asked, petulantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know! I&mdash;I&mdash;I don't seem to understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to be honest with you. You are so honest you will understand
      me, then,&rdquo; she told him. It seemed to him that he must be mistaken, but he
      certainly felt her arms were slipping up his shoulders and had met behind
      his neck. &ldquo;I saw it in your eyes long ago. A woman always knows. I wanted
      you to do what you did to-night. I knew I would be obliged to tempt you. I
      came up here while the moon and the music would help me. I did it all on
      purpose&mdash;I stood close to you&mdash;for I knew you were just my slow
      old Yankee who would never come out of his shell till I poked. There! I
      have confessed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mad joy did not allow him to see anything of the coquette in that
      confession. It all seemed to be consecrated by the love he felt for her&mdash;a
      love which was so honest that he perceived no boldness in the attitude of
      this girl who had come so far to meet him. He took her into his arms
      again, and she returned his kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me again, Boyd, that you love me,&rdquo; she coaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet I have no right to love you. You are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Hush! There goes your Yankee caution talking! I want love, for I am
      a girl. Love hasn't anything to do with what you are or what I am. Not
      now! We will love each other&mdash;and wait! You are my big boy! Aren't
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was glad to comply with her plea to put sensible talk from them just
      then. There was nothing sensible he could say. He was holding Julius
      Marston's daughter in his arms, and she was telling him that she loved
      him. The world was suddenly upside down and he was surrendering himself to
      the mad present.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
In the yacht's saloon below a woman began to sing:

     &ldquo;Love comes like a summer sigh,
     Softly o'er us stealing.
     Love comes and we wonder why
     To its shrine we're kneeling.
     Love comes as the days go by&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it,&rdquo; the girl murmured, eagerly. &ldquo;We don't know anything at all
      about why we love. Folks who marry for money make believe love&mdash;I
      have watched them&mdash;I know. I love you. You're my big boy. That's all.
      That's enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He accepted this comforting doctrine unquestioningly. Her serene
      acceptance of the situation, without one wrinkle in her placid brow to
      indicate that any future problems annoyed her, did not arouse his
      wonderment or cause him to question the depths of her emotions; it only
      added one more element to the unreality of the entire affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moon and music, silver sea and glorious night, and a maid who had been, in
      his secret thoughts, his dream of the unattainable!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you wait for me&mdash;wait till I can make something of myself?&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are yourself&mdash;right now&mdash;that's enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the future. I must&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love me&mdash;love me now&mdash;that's all we need to ask. The future
      will take care of itself when the time comes! Haven't you read about the
      great loves? How they just forgot the whole petty world? What has love to
      do with business and money and bargains? Love in its place&mdash;business
      in its place! And our love will be our secret until&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pardoned her indefiniteness, for when she paused and hesitated she
      pressed her lips to his, and that assurance was enough for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;oh yes&mdash;Miss Alma!&rdquo; called a man's voice in the singsong
      of eager summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Arthur,&rdquo; she said, with snap of impatience in her voice. &ldquo;Why won't
      people let me alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He released her, and she stood at arm's-length, her hands against his
      breast. &ldquo;I have thought&mdash;It seemed to me,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;that he&mdash;Forgive
      me, but I have loved you so! I couldn't bear to think&mdash;think that he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought I cared for him!&rdquo; she chided. &ldquo;That's only the man my father
      has picked out for me! Why, I wouldn't even allow my father to select a
      yachting-cap for me, much less a husband. I'll tell him so when the time
      comes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo's brows wrinkled in spite of himself. The morrow seemed to play small
      part in the calculations of this maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money&mdash;that's all there is to Arthur Beveridge. My father has enough
      money for all of us. And if he is stingy with us&mdash;oh, it's easy
      enough to earn money, isn't it? All men can earn money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo, sailor, was not sure of his course in financial waters and
      did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Alma! I say! Oh, where are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even that silly, little, dried-up man,&rdquo; she jeered, with a duck of her
      head in the direction of the drawling voice, &ldquo;goes down to Wall Street and
      makes thousands and thousands of dollars whenever he feels like it. And
      you could put him in your reefer pocket. They will all be afraid of you
      when you go down to Wall Street to make lots of money for us two. You
      shall see! Kiss me! Kiss me once! Kiss me quick! Here he comes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed, released her, and when Beveridge shoved his wizened face in at
      the door they were bending over the chart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say, we have missed you. They are asking for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not turn to look at him. &ldquo;I have something else on my mind,
      Arthur, besides lolling below listening to Wally Dalton fiddle love-tunes.
      And this passage, here, Captain Mayo! What is it?&rdquo; Her finger strayed idly
      across a few hundred miles of mapped Atlantic Ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Honeymoon Channel,&rdquo; replied the navigator, demurely. His new ecstasy
      made him bold enough to jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, so we are learning to be a captain, Miss Alma?&rdquo; inquired Beveridge
      with a wry smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be better if more yacht-owners knew how to manage their own
      craft,&rdquo; she informed him, with spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it might keep the understrappers in line,&rdquo; agreed the man at the
      door.. &ldquo;I apply for the position of first mate after you qualify, Captain
      Alma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this, you say, is, Captain Mayo?&rdquo; she queried, without troubling
      herself to reply. Her tone was crisply matter of fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beveridge blinked at her and showed the disconcerted uneasiness of a man
      who has intruded in business hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo, watching the white finger rapturously, noted that it was
      sweeping from the Arctic Circle to the Tropic Zone. &ldquo;That's Love Harbor,
      reached through the thoroughfare of Hope,&rdquo; he answered, respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; exclaimed Beveridge; &ldquo;the sailors who laid out that course
      must have been romantic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sailors have souls to correspond with their horizon, Arthur. Would you
      prefer such names as Cash Cove and Money-grub Channel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beveridge cocked an eyebrow and stared at her eloquent back; also, he
      cast a glance of no great favor on the stalwart young captain of the <i>Olenia</i>.
      It certainly did not occur to Mr. Beveridge that two young folks in love
      were making sport of him. That Julius Marston's daughter would descend to
      a yacht captain would have appeared as incredible an enormity as an affair
      with the butler. But there was something about this intimate companionship
      of the chart-room which Mr. Beveridge did not relish. Instinct rather than
      any sane reason told him that he was not wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry to break in on your studies, Miss Marston,&rdquo; he said, a bit
      stiffly. &ldquo;But I have been sent by your father to call you to the cabin.&rdquo;
       Mr. Beveridge's air, his tone of protest, conveyed rather pointed hint
      that her responsibilities as a hostess were fully as important as her
      studies as a navigator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relief was mingled with Captain Mayo's regret. He had feared that this
      impetuous young woman might rebel against the summons, even though the
      word came from her father. And her persistent stay in his chart-room, even
      on the pretext of a fervid interest in the mysteries of navigation, might
      produce complications. This wonderful new joy in his life was too precious
      to be marred by complications.
    </p>
    <p>
      She trailed her fingers along his hand when she turned from the
      chart-table, and then pinched him in farewell salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Captain Mayo. I'll take another lesson to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at your service,&rdquo; he told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their voices betrayed nothing, but Beveridge's keen eyes&mdash;the eyes
      which had studied faces in the greatest game of all when fortunes were at
      stake&mdash;noted the look they exchanged. It was long-drawn, as
      expressive as a lingering kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beveridge, sanctioned in his courtship by Julius Marston, was not
      especially worried by any inferences from that soft glance. He could not
      blame even a coal-heaver who might stare tenderly at Miss Alma Marston,
      for she was especially pleasing to the eye, and he enjoyed looking at her
      himself. He was enough of a philosopher to be willing to have other folks
      enjoy themselves and thereby give their approbation to his choice. He
      excused Captain Mayo. As to Miss Marston, he viewed her frivolity as he
      did that of the other girls whom he knew; they all had too much time on
      their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give the poor devils a chance, Alma. Don't tip 'em upside down,&rdquo; he
      advised, testily, when she followed him down the ladder. He stood at the
      foot and offered his hand, but she leaped down the last two steps and did
      not accept his assistance. &ldquo;Now, you have twisted that skipper of ours
      until he doesn't know north from south.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not care much for your emphasis on the 'now,'&rdquo; she declared,
      indignantly. &ldquo;You seem to intimate that I am going about the world trying
      to beguile every man I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seems to be the popular indoor and outdoor sport for girls in these
      days,&rdquo; he returned with good humor. &ldquo;Just a moment ago you were raising
      the very devil with that fellow up there with your eyes. Of course,
      practice makes perfect. But you're a good, kind girl in your heart. Don't
      make 'em miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beveridge's commiseration would have been wasted on Captain Boyd Mayo
      that evening. The captain snapped off the light in the chart-room as soon
      as they had departed, and there in the gloom he took his happiness to his
      heart, even as he had taken her delicious self to his breast. He put up
      his hands and pressed his face into the palms. He inhaled the delicate,
      subtle fragrance&mdash;a mere suggestion of perfume&mdash;the sweet ghost
      of her personality, which she had left behind. Her touch still thrilled
      him, and the warmth of her last kiss was on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went out and climbed the ladder to the bridge. A peep over the
      shoulder of the man at the wheel into the mellow glow under the hood of
      the binnacle, showed him that the <i>Olenia</i> was on her course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a beautiful night, Mr. McGaw,&rdquo; he said to the mate, a stumpy little
      man with bowed legs, who was pacing to and fro, measuring strides with the
      regularity of a pendulum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is that, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McGaw, before he answered, plainly had difficulty with something which
      bulged in his cheek. He appeared, also, to be considerably surprised by
      the captain's air of vivacious gaiety. His superior had been moping around
      the ship for many days with melancholy spelled in every line of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's the most beautiful and perfect night I ever saw, Mr. McGaw.&rdquo;
       There was triumph in the captain's buoyant tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must be allowed to be what they call a starry night for a ramble,&rdquo;
       admitted the mate, trying to find speech to fit the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take the rest of this watch and the middle watch, Mr. McGaw,&rdquo;
       offered the captain. &ldquo;I want to stay up to-night. I can't go to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The offer meant that Captain Mayo proposed to stay on duty until four
      o'clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mate McGaw fiddled a gnarled finger under his nose and tried to find some
      words of protest. But Captain Mayo added a crisp command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go below, Mr. McGaw, and take it easy. You can make it up to me some time
      when there is no moon!&rdquo; He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all the cabin lights were out and he realized that she must be
      asleep, he walked the bridge, exulting because her safety was in his
      hands, but supremely exultant because she loved him and had told him so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obedience had been in the line of his training.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had commanded him to live and love in the present, allowing the future
      to take care of itself, and it afforded him a sense of sweet companionship
      to obey her slightest wish when he was apart from her. Therefore, he put
      aside all thoughts of Julius Marston and his millions&mdash;Julius
      Marston, his master, owner of the yacht which swept on under the moon&mdash;that
      frigid, silent man with the narrow strip of frosty beard pointing his
      chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo walked the bridge and lived and loved.

      II ~ THEN CAPTAIN MAYO SEES SHOALS
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     There's naught upon the stern, there's naught upon the lee,
     Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we.
     But there's a lofty ship to windward,
     And she's sailing fast and free,
     Sailing down along the coast of the high Barbaree.
                        &mdash;Ancient Shanty.
</pre>
    <p>
      The skipper of the <i>Olenia</i> found himself dabbling in guesses and
      wonderment more than is good for a man who is expected to obey without
      asking the reason why.
    </p>
    <p>
      That cruise seemed to be a series of spasmodic alternations between
      leisurely loafing and hustling haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were days when he was ordered to amble along at half speed offshore.
      Then for hours together Julius Marston and his two especial and close
      companions, men of affairs, plainly, men of his kind, bunched themselves
      close together in their hammock chairs under the poop awning and talked
      interminably. Alma Marston and her young friends, chaperoned by an amiable
      aunt&mdash;so Captain Mayo understood her status in the party&mdash;remained
      considerately away from the earnest group of three. Arthur Beveridge
      attached himself to the young folks.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the bridge the captain caught glimpses of all this shipboard routine.
      The yacht's saunterings offshore seemed a part of the summer vacation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the occasional hurryings into harbors, the conferences below with men
      who came and went with more or less attempt at secrecy, did not fit with
      the vacation side of the cruise.
    </p>
    <p>
      These conferences were often followed by orders to the captain to thread
      inner reaches of the coast and to visit unfrequented harbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo had been prepared for these trips, although he had not been
      informed of the reason. It was his first season on the yacht <i>Olenia</i>.
      The shipping broker who had hired him had been searching in his inquiries
      as to Mayo's knowledge of the byways of the coast. The young man who had
      captained fishermen and coasters ever since he was seventeen years old had
      found it easy to convince the shipping broker, and the shipping broker had
      sent him on board the yacht without the formality of an interview with the
      owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo was informed curtly that there was no need of an interview. He was
      told that Julius Marston never bothered with details.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Julius Marston had come on board with his party he merely nodded grim
      acknowledgment of the salute of his yacht's master, who stood at the
      gangway, cap in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The owner had never shown any interest in the management of the yacht; he
      had remained abaft the main gangway; he had never called the captain into
      conference regarding any movements of the <i>Olenia</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo, pacing the bridge in the forenoon watch, trying to grasp the
      full measure of his fortune after troubled dreams of his master's
      daughter, recollected that he had never heard the sound of Julius
      Marston's voice. So far as personal contact was concerned, the yacht's
      skipper was evidently as much a matter of indifference to the owner as the
      yacht's funnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orders were always brought forward by a pale young man who was taciturn
      even to rudeness, and by that trait seemed to commend himself to Marston
      as a safe secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, Alma Marston had brought her friends to the bridge. But after
      the novelty was gone they seemed to prefer the comfort of chairs astern or
      the saloon couches.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time the attentive Beveridge had followed her when she came forward;
      and then Beveridge discovered that she quite disregarded him in her quest
      for information from the tall young man in uniform. She came alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after that what had happened happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came alone that forenoon. He saw her coming. He had stolen a glance
      aft every time he turned in his walk at the end of the bridge. He leaned
      low and reached down his hand to assist her up the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been nigh crazy all morning. But I had to wait a decent time and
      listen to their gossip after breakfast,&rdquo; she told him, her face close to
      his as she came up the ladder. &ldquo;And, besides, my father is snappy to-day.
      He scolded me last night for neglecting my guests. Just as if I were
      called on to sit all day and listen to Nan Burgess appraise her lovers or
      to sing a song every time Wally Dalton has his relapse of lovesickness. He
      has come away to forget her, you know.&rdquo; She chuckled, uttering her funny
      little gurgle of a laugh which stirred in him, always, a desire to smother
      it with kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to the end of the bridge, apart from the man at the wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hurried to go to sleep last night so that I could dream of you, my own
      big boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I walked the bridge until after daylight. I wanted to stay awake. I could
      not bear to let sleep take away my thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there like love to make this world full of happiness? How bright
      the sun is! How the waves sparkle! Those folks sitting back there are
      looking at the same things we are&mdash;or they can look, though they
      don't seem to have sense enough. And about all they notice is that it's
      daylight instead of night. My father and those men are talking about money&mdash;just
      money&mdash;that's all. And Wally has a headache from drinking too much
      Scotch. And Nan Burgess doesn't love anybody who loves her, But for us&mdash;oh,
      this glorious world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put out her arms toward the sun and stared boldly at that blazing orb,
      as though she were not satisfied with what her eyes could behold, but
      desired to grasp and feel some of the glory of outdoors. If Captain Mayo
      had been as well versed in psychology as he was in navigation he might
      have drawn a few disquieting deductions from this frank and unconscious
      expression of the mood of the materialist. She emphasized that mood by
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll show you my little clasp-book some day, big boy. It's where I write
      my verses. I don't show them to anybody. You see, I'm telling you my
      secrets! We must tell each other our secrets, you and I! I have put my
      philosophy of living into four lines. Listen!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The future? Why perplex the soul? The past? Forget its woe and strife!
      Let's thread each day, a perfect whole, Upon our rosary of Life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's beautiful,&rdquo; he told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it good philosophy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted, not daring to doubt the high priestess of the new cult
      to which he had been commandeered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It saves all this foolish worry. Most of the folks I know are always
      talking about the bad things which have happened to them or are peering
      forward and hoping that good things will happen, and they never once look
      down and admire a golden moment which Fate has dropped into their hands.
      You see, I'm poetical this morning. Why shouldn't I be? We love each
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how to talk,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I'm only a sailor. I never said
      a word about love to any girl in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure you have never loved anybody? Remember, we must tell each
      other our secrets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; he declared with convincing firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She surveyed him, showing the satisfaction a gold-seeker would exhibit in
      appraising a nugget of virgin ore. &ldquo;But you are so big and fine! And you
      must have met so many pretty girls!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was not restive under this quizzing. &ldquo;I have told you the truth, Miss
      Marston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, big boy! 'Miss Marston,' indeed! I am Alma&mdash;Alma to you.
      Say it! Say it nicely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flushed. He stole a shamefaced glance at the-wheelsman and made a quick
      and apprehensive survey of the sacred regions aft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you afraid, after all I have said to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but it seems&mdash;I can hardly believe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alma,&rdquo; he gulped. &ldquo;Alma, I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need some lessons, big boy. You are so awkward I think you are
      telling me the truth about the other girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not dare to ask her whether she had loved any one else. With all
      the passionate jealousy of his soul he wanted to ask her. She, who was so
      sure that she could instruct him, must have loved somebody. He tried to
      comfort himself by the thought that her knowledge arose from the efforts
      either men had made to win her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have our To-day,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Golden hours till the moon comes up&mdash;and
      then perhaps a few silver ones! I don't care what Arthur guesses. My
      father is too busy talking money with those men to guess. I'm going to be
      with you all I can. I can arrange it. I'm studying navigation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She snuggled against the rail, luxuriating in the sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she asked, bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      That question, coming after the pledging of their affection, astonished
      him like the loom of a ledge in mid-channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's enough for me that you are just as you are, boy! But you're not a
      prince in disguise, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm only a Yankee sailor,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;But if you won't think that I'm
      trying to trade on what my folks have been before me, I'll say that my
      grandfather was Gamaliel Mayo of Mayoport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds good, but I never heard of him. With all my philosophy, I'm a
      poor student of history, sweetheart.&rdquo; Her tone and the name she gave him
      took the sting out of her confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe he played a great part in history. But he built sixteen
      ships in his day, and our house flag circled the world many times. Sixteen
      big ships, and the last one was the <i>Harvest Home</i>, the China clipper
      that paid for herself three times before an Indian Ocean monsoon swallowed
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if he made all that money, are you going to sea for the fun of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no more Yankee wooden ships on the sea. My poor father thought
      he was wise when the wooden ships were crowded off. He put his money into
      railroads&mdash;and you know what has happened to most of the folks who
      have put their money into new railroads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I don't know much about business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hawks caught the doves. It was a game that was played all over New
      England. The folks whose money built the roads were squeezed out. Long
      before my mother died our money was gone, but my father and I did not
      allow her to know it. We mortgaged and gave her what she had always been
      used to. And when my father died there was nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes glistened. &ldquo;That's chivalry,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;That's the spirit of
      the knights of old when women were concerned. I adore you for what you
      did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the way my father and I looked at it,&rdquo; he said, mildly. &ldquo;My father
      was not a very practical man, but I always agreed with him. And I am happy
      now, earning my own living. Why should I think my grandfather ought to
      have worked all his life so that I would not need to work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it's different with a big, strong man and a woman. She needs so
      much that a man must give her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo became promptly silent, crestfallen, and embarrassed. He
      stared aft, he looked at the splendid yacht whose finances he managed and
      whose extravagance he knew. He saw the girl at his side, and blinked at
      the gems which flashed in the sunlight as her fingers tucked up the locks
      of hair where the breeze had wantoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think my father works because he loves it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wish he would
      rest and enjoy other things more. If mother had lived to influence him
      perhaps he would see something else in life instead of merely piling up
      money. But he doesn't listen to me. He gives me money and tells me to go
      and play. I miss my mother, boy! I haven't anybody to talk with&mdash;who
      understands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were tears in her eyes, and he was grateful for them. He felt that
      she had depths in her nature. But keen realization of his position,
      compared with hers, distressed him. She stood there, luxury incarnate,
      mistress of all that money could give her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody can make money,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;My father and those men are
      sitting there and building plans to bring them thousands and thousands of
      dollars. All they need to do is put their heads together and plan. Every
      now and then I hear a few words. They're going to own all the steamboats&mdash;or
      something of that kind. Anybody can make money, I say, but there are so
      few who know how to enjoy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been doing a lot of thinking since last night&mdash;Alma.&rdquo; He
      hesitated when he came to her name, and then blurted it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it is real lover-like to treat my name as if it were a
      hurdle that you must leap over?&rdquo; she asked, with her aggravating little
      chuckle. &ldquo;Oh, you have so much to learn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid so. I have a great many things ahead of me to learn and do. I
      have been thinking. I have been afraid of the men who sit and scheme and
      put all their minds on making money. They did bitter things to us, and we
      didn't understand until it was all over. But I must go among them and
      watch them and learn how to make money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be like the others, now, and talk money&mdash;money,&rdquo; she said,
      pettishly. &ldquo;Money and their love-affairs&mdash;that's the talk I have
      heard from men ever since I was allowed to come into the drawing-room out
      of the nursery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must talk money a little, dear. I have my way to make in the
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrifty, practical, and Yankee!&rdquo; she jested. &ldquo;I suppose you can't help
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't for myself&mdash;it's for you!&rdquo; he returned, wistfully, and with
      a voice and demeanor he offered himself as Love's sacrifice before her&mdash;the
      old story of utter devotion&mdash;the ancient sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have all I want,&rdquo; she insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>I</i> must be able to give you what you want!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I warn you that I hate money-grubbers! They haven't a spark of romance in
      them. Boyd, you'd be like all the rest in a little while. You mustn't do
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must have position&mdash;means before I dare to go to your father&mdash;if
      I ever shall be able to go to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to him for what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To ask him&mdash;to say&mdash;to&mdash;well, when we feel that I'm in a
      position where we can be married&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we shall be married some day, boy, but all that will take care
      of itself when the time comes. But now you are&mdash; How old are you,
      Boyd?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am nineteen. And what has marriage to do with the love we are
      enjoying right now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When folks are in love they want to get married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granted! But when lovers are wise they will treat romance at first as the
      epicure treats his glass of good wine. They will pour it slowly and hold
      the glass up against the light and admire its color!&rdquo; In her gay mood she
      pinched together thumb and forefinger and lifted an imaginary glass to the
      sun. &ldquo;Then they will sniff the bouquet. Ah-h-h, how fragrant! And after a
      time they will take a little sip&mdash;just a weeny little sip and hold it
      on the tongue for ever so long. For, when it is swallowed, what good? Oh,
      boy, here are you&mdash;talking first of all about marriage! Talking of
      the good wine of life and love as if it were a fluid simply to satisfy
      thirst. We are going to love, first of all! Come, I will teach you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not know what to say to her. There was a species of abandon in her
      gaiety. Her exotic language embarrassed one who had been used to mariners'
      laconic directness of speech. She looked at him, teasing him with her
      eyes. He was a bit relieved when the pale-faced secretary came dragging
      himself up the ladder and broke in on the tête-à-tête.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Marston's orders are, Captain Mayo, that you turn here and go west.
      Do you know the usual course of the Bee line steamers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He requests you to turn in toward shore and follow that course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir.&rdquo; Captain Mayo walked to the wheel. &ldquo;Nor' nor'west, Billy,
      until I can give you the exact course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor' nor'west!&rdquo; repeated the wheelsman, throwing her hard over, and the
      <i>Olenia</i> came about with a rail-dipping swerve and retraced her way
      along her own wake of white suds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Marston preceded the captain down the ladder and went into the
      chart-room. &ldquo;A kiss&mdash;quick!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her close to him for a long moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a most obedient captain,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he released her and went at his task, she leaned upon his shoulder
      and watched him as he straddled his parallels across the chart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll run to Razee Reef,&rdquo; he told her, eager to make her a partner in all
      his little concerns. &ldquo;The Bee boats fetch the whistler there so as to lay
      off their next leg. I didn't know that Mr. Marston was interested in the
      Bee line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard him talking about that line,&rdquo; she said, indifferently. &ldquo;Sometimes
      I listen when I have nothing else to do. He used a naughty word about
      somebody connected with that company&mdash;and it's so seldom that he
      allows himself to swear I listened to see what it was all about. I don't
      know even now. I don't understand such things. But he said if he couldn't
      buy 'em he'd bu'st 'em. Those were his words. Not very elegant language.
      But it's all I remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before he left the chart-room Mayo took a squint at the barometer. &ldquo;I'm
      sorry he has ordered me in toward the coast,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The glass is too
      far below thirty to suit me. I think it means fog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's so clear and beautiful,&rdquo; she protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's always especially beautiful at sea before something bad happens,&rdquo; he
      explained, smiling. &ldquo;And there has been a big fog-bank off to s'uth'ard
      for two days. It's a good deal like life, dear. All lovely, and then the
      fog shuts in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I would be happy with you in the fog,&rdquo; she assured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glowed at her words and answered with his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have followed him back upon the bridge, but the steward
      intercepted her. He had waited outside the chart-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Marston's compliments, Miss Marston! He requests you to join him at
      cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pouted as she gave back Mayo's look of annoyance, and then obeyed the
      mandate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Marston was stroking his narrow strip of chin beard with thumb and
      forefinger when she arrived on the quarter-deck. The men of business were
      below, and he motioned to a hammock chair beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alma, for the rest of this cruise I want you to stay back here with our
      guests where you belong,&rdquo; he commanded with the directness of attack
      employed by Julius Marston in his dealings with those of his ménage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&mdash;exactly. I was explicit, was I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do not intimate that&mdash;that I have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Mr. Marston believed in allowing others to expose their sentiments
      before he uncovered his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't suggest that there is anything wrong in my being on the bridge
      where I enjoy myself so much. I am trying to learn something about
      navigation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am paying that fellow up there to attend to all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it gets tiresome back here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You selected your own company for the cruise&mdash;and there is Mr.
      Beveridge ready to amuse you at any time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Beveridge amuses me&mdash;distinctly amuses me,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;But
      there is such a thing as becoming wearied even of such a joke as Mr.
      Beveridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will please employ a more respectful tone when you refer to that
      gentleman,&rdquo; said her father, with severity. But he promptly fell back into
      his usual mood when she came into his affairs. He was patronizingly
      tolerant. &ldquo;Your friend, Miss Burgess, has been joking about your sudden
      devotion to navigation, Alma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nan Burgess cannot keep her tongue still, even about herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, but I do not intend to have you give occasion even for jokes. Of
      course, I understand. I know your whims. You are interested, personally,
      in that gold-braided chap about as much as you would be interested in that
      brass thing where the compass is&mdash;whatever they call it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he's a gentleman!&rdquo; she cried, her interest making her unwary. &ldquo;His
      grandfather was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alma!&rdquo; snapped Julius Marston. His eyes opened wide. He looked her up and
      down. &ldquo;I have heard before that an ocean trip makes women silly, I am
      inclined to believe it. I don't care a curse who that fellow's grandfather
      was. <i>You</i> are my daughter&mdash;and you keep off that bridge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men of business were coming up the companion-way, and she rose and
      hurried to her stateroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't dare to meet Nan Burgess just now,&rdquo; she told herself.
      &ldquo;Friendships can be broken by saying certain things&mdash;and I feel
      perfectly capable of saying just those things to her at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the late afternoon the <i>Olenia</i>, the shore-line looming to
      starboard, shaped her course to meet and pass a big steamer which came
      rolling down the sea with a banner of black smoke flaunting behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fog which Captain Mayo had predicted was coming. Wisps of it trailed
      over the waves&mdash;skirmishers sent ahead of the main body which marched
      in mass more slowly behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A whistling buoy, with its grim grunt, told all mariners to 'ware Razee
      Reef, which was lifting its jagged, black bulk against the sky-line. With
      that fog coming, Captain Mayo needed to take exact bearings from Razee,
      for he had decided to run for harbor that night. That coastline, to whose
      inside course Marston's orders had sent the yacht, was too dangerous to be
      negotiated in a night which was fog-wrapped. Therefore, the captain took
      the whistler nearly dead on, leaving to the larger steamer plenty of room
      in the open sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      With considerable amazement Mayo noticed that the other fellow was edging
      toward the whistler at a sharper angle than any one needed. That course,
      if persisted in, would pinch the yacht in dangerous waters. Mayo gave the
      on-coming steamer one whistle, indicating his intention to pass to
      starboard. After a delay he was answered by two hoarse hoots&mdash;a most
      flagrant breach of the rules of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be a mistake,&rdquo; Captain Mayo informed Mate McGaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a polite name for it, sir,&rdquo; averred Mr. McGaw, after he had
      shifted the lump in his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he doesn't mean it, Mr. McGaw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why isn't he giving us elbow-room on the outside of that buoy, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't swing and cross his bows now. If he should hit us we'd be the
      ones held for the accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Mayo gave the obstinate steamer a single whistle-blast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he cross-signals me again I'll report him,&rdquo; he informed the mate. &ldquo;Pay
      close attention, Mr. McGaw, and you, too, Billy. We may have to go before
      the inspectors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the big chap ahead of them did not deign to reply. He kept on straight
      at the whistler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compliments of Mr. Marston!&rdquo; called the secretary from the bridge ladder.
      &ldquo;What steamer is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Conorno</i> of the Bee line, sir,&rdquo; stated Captain Mayo over his
      shoulder. Then he ripped out a good, hearty, deep-water oath. According to
      appearances, incredible as the situation seemed, the <i>Conorno</i>
      proposed to drive the yacht inside the whistler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo ran to the wheel and yanked the bell-pull furiously. There were four
      quick clangs in the engine-room, and in a moment the <i>Olenia</i> began
      to quiver in all her fabric. Going full speed ahead, Mayo had called for
      full speed astern. Then he sounded three whistles, signaling as the rules
      of the road provide. The yacht's twin screws churned a yeasty riot under
      her counter, and while she was laboring thus in her own wallow, trembling
      like some living thing in the extremity of terror, the big steamer swept
      past. Froth from the creamy surges at her bows flicked spray
      contemptuously upon Julius Marston and his guests on the <i>Olenia</i>'s
      quarter-deck. Men grinned down upon them from the high windows of the
      steamer's pilot-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      A jeering voice boomed through a megaphone: &ldquo;Keep out of the way of the
      Bee line! Take the hint!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An officer pointed his finger at Marston's house flag, snapping from the
      yacht's main truck. The blue fish-tail with its letter &ldquo;M&rdquo; had revealed
      the yacht's identity to searching glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better make it black! Skull and cross-bones!&rdquo; volunteered the megaphone
      operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      On she went down the sea and the <i>Olenia</i> tossed in the turbulent
      wake of the kicking screws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, for the first time, Captain Mayo heard the sound of Julius Marston's
      voice. The magnate stood up, shook his fist at his staring captain, and
      yelled, &ldquo;What in damnation do you think you are doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was amazing, insulting, and, under the circumstances as Mayo knew them,
      an unjust query. The master of the <i>Olenia</i> did not reply. He was not
      prepared to deliver any long-distance explanation. Furthermore, the yacht
      demanded all his attention just then. He gave his orders and she forged
      ahead to round the whistler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor'west by west, half west, Billy. And cut it fine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fog had fairly leaped upon them from the sea. The land-breeze had been
      holding back the wall of vapor, damming it in a dun bank to southward. The
      breeze had let go. The fog had seized its opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saturday Cove for us to-night, Mr. McGaw,&rdquo; said the master. &ldquo;Keep your
      eye over Billy's shoulder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the secretary appeared again on the ladder. This time he did not
      bring any &ldquo;compliments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Marston wants you to report aft at once,&rdquo; he announced, brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo hesitated a moment. They were driving into blankness which had shut
      down with that smothering density which mariners call &ldquo;a dungeon fog.&rdquo;
       Saturday Cove's entrance was a distant and a small target. In spite of
      steersman and mate, his was the sole responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you please explain to Mr. Marston that I cannot leave the bridge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have straight orders from him, captain! You'd better stop the boat
      and report.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The skipper of the <i>Olenia</i> was having his first taste of the
      unreasoning whim of the autocrat who was entitled to break into shipboard
      discipline, even in a critical moment. Mayo felt exasperation surging in
      him, but he was willing to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whistler and Razee Reef had been blotted out by the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this vessel is stopped five minutes in this tide-drift we shall lose
      our bearings, sir. I cannot leave this bridge for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm thinking you'll leave it for good!&rdquo; blurted the secretary. &ldquo;You're
      the first hired man who ever told Julius Marston to go bite his own
      thumb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may be a hired man,&rdquo; retorted Mayo. &ldquo;But I am also a licensed
      shipmaster. I must ask you to step down off the bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that go for all the rest of the&mdash;passengers?&rdquo; asked the
      secretary, angry in his turn. He dwelt on his last word. &ldquo;It does&mdash;in
      a time like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I'll give them that word aft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo caught a side glance from Mate McGaw after a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have often wondered,&rdquo; remarked the mate to nobody in particular, &ldquo;how
      it is that so many damn fools get rich on shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo did not express any opinion on the subject. He clutched the
      bridge rail and stared into the fog, and seemed to be having a lot of
      trouble in choking back some kind of emotion.

      III ~ THE TAVERN OF THE SEAS
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Now, Mister Macliver, you knows him quite well,
         He comes upon deck and he cuts a great swell;
     It's damn your eyes there and it's damn your eyes here,
         And straight to the gangway he takes a broad sheer.
                         &mdash;La Pique &ldquo;Come-all-ye.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Into Saturday Cove, all during that late afternoon, they came surging&mdash;spars
      and tackle limned against the on-sweeping pall of the gray fog&mdash;those
      wayfarers of the open main.
    </p>
    <p>
      First to roll in past the ledgy portals of the haven were the venerable
      sea-wagons&mdash;the coasters known as the &ldquo;Apple-treers.&rdquo; Their
      weatherwise skippers, old sea-dogs who could smell weather as bloodhounds
      sniff trails, had their noses in the air in good season that day, and knew
      that they must depend on a thinning wind to cuff them into port. One after
      the other, barnacled anchors splashed from catheads, dragging rusty chains
      from hawse-holes, and old, patched sails came sprawling down with chuckle
      of sheaves and lisp of running rigging.
    </p>
    <p>
      A 'long-coast shanty explains the nickname, &ldquo;Apple-treers&rdquo;:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     O, what's the use of compass or a quadrant or a log?
     Keep her loafin' on her mudhook in a norther or a fog.
     But as soon's the chance is better, then well ratch her off once more,
     Keepin' clost enough for bearings from the apple-trees ashore.
</pre>
    <p>
      Therefore, the topsail schooners, the fore-and-afters, the Bluenose
      blunt-prows, came in early before the fog smooched out the loom of the
      trees and before it became necessary to guess at what the old card
      compasses had to reveal on the subject of courses.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, along with the rest of the coastwise ragtag, which was seeking
      harbor and holding-ground, came the ancient schooner <i>Polly</i>.
      Fog-masked by those illusory mists, she was a shadow ship like the others;
      but, more than the others, she seemed to be a ghost ship, for her lines
      and her rig informed any well-posted mariner that she must be a
      centenarian; with her grotesqueness accentuated by the fog pall, she
      seemed unreal&mdash;a picture from the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had an out-thrust of snub bow and an upcock of square stern, and sag
      of waist&mdash;all of which accurately revealed ripe antiquity, just as a
      bell-crowned beaver and a swallow-tail coat with brass buttons would
      identify an old man in the ruck of newer fashions. She had seams like the
      wrinkles in the parchment skin of extreme old age. She carried a wooden
      figurehead under her bowsprit, the face and bust of a woman on whom an
      ancient woodcarver had bestowed his notion of a beatific smile; the result
      was an idiotic simper. The glorious gilding had been worn off, the wood
      was gray and cracked. The <i>Polly's</i> galley was entirely hidden under
      a deckload of shingles and laths in bunches; the after-house was broad and
      loomed high above the rail in contrast to the mere cubbies which were
      provided for the other fore-and-afters in the flotilla which came ratching
      in toward Saturday Cove.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Polly</i>, being old enough to be celebrated, had been the subject
      of a long-coast lyric of seventeen verses, any one of which was capable of
      producing most horrible profanity from Captain Epps Candage, her master,
      whenever he heard the ditty echoing over the waves, sung by a satirist
      aboard another craft.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that drifting wind there was leisure; a man on board a lime-schooner at
      a fairly safe distance from the <i>Polly</i> found inclination and lifted
      his voice:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Ow-w-w, here comes the <i>Polly</i> with a lopped-down sail,
          And Rubber-boot Epps, is a-settin' on her rail.
     How-w-w long will she take to get to Boston town?
         Can't just tell 'cause she's headin' up and down.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that kind o' ky-yi is funny, do you, you walnut-nosed,
      blue-gilled, goggle-eyed son of a dough-faced americaneezus?&rdquo; bellowed
      Captain Candage, from his post at the <i>Polly's</i> wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; remonstrated a girl who stood in the companionway, her elbows
      propped on the hatch combings. &ldquo;Such language! You stop it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't half what I can do when I'm fair started,&rdquo; returned the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never say such things on shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I ain't on shore now, be I? I'm on the high seas, and I'm talking
      to fit the occasion. Who's running this schooner, you or me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She met his testiness with a spirit of her own, &ldquo;I'm on board here, where
      I don't want to be, because of your silly notions, father. I have the
      right to ask you to use decent language, and not shame us both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Against the archaically homely background the beauty of the young girl
      appeared in most striking contrast. Her curls peeped out from under the
      white Dutch cap she wore. Her eyes sparkled with indignant protest, her
      face was piquant and was just then flushed, and her nose had the least bit
      of a natural uptilt, giving her the air of a young woman who had a will of
      her own to spice her amiability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage blinked at her over the spokes of the wheel, and in his
      father's heart acknowledged her charm, realizing more acutely that his
      motherless girl had become too much of a problem for his limited knowledge
      in the management of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not seen her grow up gradually, as other fathers had viewed their
      daughters, being able to meet daily problems in molding and mastery.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to reach development, mental and physical, in disconcerting
      phases while he was away on his voyages. Each time he met her he was
      obliged to get acquainted all over again, it appeared to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage had owned up frankly to himself that he was not able to
      exercise any authority over his daughter when she was ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not wilful; she was not obstinate; she gave him affection. But she
      had become a young woman while his slow thoughts were classing her still
      as a child. She was always ahead of all his calculations. In his absences
      she jumped from stage to stage of character&mdash;almost of identity! He
      had never forgotten how he had brought back to her from New York, after
      one voyage, half a gunny sackful of tin toys, and discovered that in his
      absence, by advice and sanction of her aunt, who had become her
      foster-mother, she had let her dresses down to ankle-length and had become
      a young lady whom he called &ldquo;Miss Candage&rdquo; twice before he had managed to
      get his emotions straightened out. While he was wondering about the
      enormity of tin toys in the gunny sack at his feet, as he sat in the
      aunt's parlor; his daughter asked him to come as guest of honor with the
      Sunday-school class's picnic which she was arranging as teacher. That gave
      him his opportunity to lie about the toys and allege that he had brought
      them for her scholars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage, on the deck of his ship, found that he was able to muster
      a little courage and bluster for a few minutes, but he did not dare to
      look at her for long while he was asserting himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her then as she stood in the gloomy companionway, a radiant
      and rosy picture of healthy maidenhood. But the expression on her face was
      not comfortingly filial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I must say it again. I can't help saying it. I am so unhappy. You
      are misjudging me so cruelly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I done it because I thought it was right to do it. I haven't been tending
      and watching the way a father ought to tend and watch. I never seemed to
      be able to ketch up with you. Maybe I ain't right. Maybe I be! At any
      rate, I'm going to stand on this tack, in your case, for a while longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have taken me away from my real home for this? This is no place for a
      girl! You are not the same as you are when you are on shore. I didn't know
      you could be so rough&mdash;and&mdash;wicked!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on there, daughter! Snub cable right there! I'm an honest,
      God-fearing, hard-working man&mdash;paying a hundred cents on the dollar,
      and you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what did you just shout&mdash;right out where everybody could hear
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&mdash;that was only passing the compliments of the day as compared
      with what I can do when I get started proper. Do you think I'm going to
      let any snub-snooted wart-hog of a lime-duster sing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's a girl know about the things a father has to put up with when he
      goes to sea and earns money for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am willing to work for myself. You took me right out of my good
      position in the millinery-store. You have made me leave all my young
      friends. Oh, I am so homesick!&rdquo; Her self-reliance departed suddenly. She
      choked. She tucked her head into the hook of her arm and sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't do that!&rdquo; he pleaded, softening suddenly. &ldquo;Please don't, Polly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up and smiled&mdash;a pleading, wan little smile. &ldquo;I didn't
      mean to give way to it, popsy dear. I don't intend to do anything to make
      you angry or sorry. I have tried to be a good girl. I am a good girl. But
      it breaks my heart when you don't trust me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were courting you,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;Them shore dudes was hanging
      around you. I ain't doubting you, Polly. But you 'ain't got no mother. I
      was afraid. I know I've been a fool about it. But I was afraid!&rdquo; Tears
      sprinkled his bronzed cheeks. &ldquo;I haven't been much of a father because
      I've had to go sailing and earn money. But I thought I'd take you away
      till-till I could sort of plan on something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him, softening visibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Polly,&rdquo; he said, his voice breaking, &ldquo;you don't know how pretty you
      are-you don't know how afraid I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can trust me, father,&rdquo; she promised, after a pause, with simple
      dignity. &ldquo;I know I am only a country girl, not wise, perhaps, but I know
      what is right and what is wrong. Can't you understand how terribly you
      have hurt my pride and my self-respect by forcing me to come and be penned
      up here as if I were a shameless girl who could not take care of herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I have done wrong, Polly. But I don't know much-not about women
      folk. I was trying to do right-because you're all I have in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will think it all over,&rdquo; she advised, earnestly. &ldquo;You will
      understand after a time, father, I'm sure. Then you will let me go back
      and you will trust me-as your own daughter should be trusted. That's the
      right way to make girls good-let them know that they can be trusted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are probably right,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I will think it all over. As soon
      as we get in and anchored I'll sit down and give it a good overhauling in
      my mind. Maybe-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took advantage of his pause. &ldquo;We are going into a harbor, are we,
      father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Right ahead of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would put me ashore and send me back. I shall lose my position
      in the store if I stay away too long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His obstinacy showed again, promptly. &ldquo;I don't want you in that
      millinery-shop. I'm told that dude drummers pester girls in stores.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do not trouble me, father. Haven't you any confidence in your own
      daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; he said, firmly, and then added, &ldquo;but I keep thinking of
      the dudes and then I get afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave him quick a glance, plainly tempted to make an impatient retort,
      and then turned and went down into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be mad with me, Polly,&rdquo; he called after her. &ldquo;I guess, maybe, I'm
      all wrong. I'm going to think it over; I ain't promising nothing sure, but
      it won't be none surprising if I set you ashore here and send you back
      home. Don't cry, little girl.&rdquo; There were tears in his voice as well as in
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lime-schooner vocalist felt an impulse to voice another verse:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Ow-w-w, here comes the <i>Polly</i> in the middle of the road,
          Towed by a mule and paving-blocks her load.
      Devil is a-waiting and the devil may as well,
     'Cause he'll never get them paving-blocks to finish paving hell.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Captain Candage left his wheel and strode to the rail. All the softness
      was gone from his face and his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You horn-jawed, muck-faced jezebo of a sea-sculpin, you dare to yap out
      any more of that sculch and I'll come aboard you after we anchor and jump
      down your gullet and gallop the etarnal innards out of ye! Don't you know
      that I've got ladies aboard here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don't sound like it,&rdquo; returned the songster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you hear what <i>I</i> sound like! Half-hitch them jaw taakuls of
      yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage's meditations were not disturbed after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the assistance of his one helper aboard ship, &ldquo;Oakum Otie,&rdquo; a gray
      and whiskered individual who combined in one person the various offices of
      first mate, second mate, A-1 seaman, and hand before the mast-as well as
      the skipper's boon companion-the <i>Polly</i> was manoeuvered to her
      anchorage in Saturday Cove and was snugged for the night. Smoke began to
      curl in blue wreaths from her galley funnel, and there were occasional
      glimpses of the cook, a sallow-complexioned, one-eyed youth whose chief
      and everlasting decoration provided him with the nickname of &ldquo;Smut-nosed
      Dolph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came some of the ocean aristocrats to join the humbler guests in that
      tavern of the seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avant couriers of a metropolitan yacht club, on its annual cruise,
      arrived, jockeying in with billowing mountains of snowy canvas spread to
      catch the last whispers of the breeze. Later arrivals, after the breeze
      failed, were towed in by the smart motor craft of the fleet. One by one,
      as the anchors splashed, brass cannons barked salute and were answered by
      the commodore's gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage sat on the edge of the <i>Polly's</i> house and snapped an
      involuntary and wrathful wink every time a cannon banged. In that
      hill-bound harbor, where the fog had massed, every noise was magnified as
      by a sounding-board. There were cheery hails, yachtsmen bawled over the
      mist-gemmed brass rails interchange of the day's experiences, and frisking
      yacht tenders, barking staccato exhausts, began to carry men to and fro on
      errands of sociability. In the silences Captain Candage could hear the
      popping of champagne corks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them fellers certainly live high and sleep in the garret,&rdquo; observed Oakum
      Otie. He was seated cross-legged on the top of the house and was hammering
      down the lumps in a freshly twisted eye-splice with the end of a
      marlinespike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has always been a wonder to me,&rdquo; growled Captain Candage, &ldquo;how dudes
      who don't seem to have no more wit than them fellows haw-hawing over
      there, and swigging liquor by the cart-load, ever make money the way they
      do so as to afford all this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On that point Captain Candage might have found Mate McGaw of the <i>Olenia</i>
      willing to engage in profitable discussion and amicable understanding!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don't make it-they don't know enough to make it,&rdquo; stated Otie, with
      the conviction of a man who knew exactly what he was talking about. &ldquo;It
      has all been left to 'em by their fathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bearded and brown men of the apple-tree crews leaned the patched
      elbows of their old coats on the rails and gloomily surveyed the
      conviviality on board the plaything crafts. Remarks which they exchanged
      with one another were framed to indicate a sort of lofty scorn for these
      frolickers of the sea. The coasting skippers, most of whom wore hard hats,
      as if they did not want to be confounded with those foppish yacht
      captains, patrolled their quarter-decks and spat disdainfully over their
      rails.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everlastingly there was the clank of pumps on board the Apple-treers, and
      the pumps were tackling the everlasting leaks. Water reddened by contact
      with bricks, water made turbid by percolation through paving-blocks,
      splashed continuously from hiccuping scuppers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Ranse Lougee of the topsail schooner <i>Belvedere</i>, laden with
      fish scraps for a Boston glue-factory, dropped over the counter into his
      dory and came rowing to the <i>Polly</i>, standing up and facing forward
      and swaying with the fisherman's stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      He straddled easily over the schooner's scant freeboard and came aft, and
      was greeted cordially by Captain Candage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought I'd show them frosted-cakers that there's a little sociability
      amongst the gents in the coasting trade, too,&rdquo; he informed his host.
      &ldquo;Furthermore, I want to borry the ex-act time o' day. <i>And</i>,
      furthermore, I'm glad to get away from that cussed aromy on board the <i>Belvedere</i>
      and sort of air out my nose once in a while. What's the good word, Cap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage replied to the commonplaces of the other skipper in
      abstracted fashion. He had viewed Lougee's approach with interest, and now
      he was plainly pondering in regard to something wholly outside this
      chatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Lougee,&rdquo; he broke in, suddenly, in low tones, &ldquo;I want you should
      come forward with me out of hearing of anybody below. I've got a little
      taakul I want you to help me overhaul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two walked forward over the deckload and sat on the fore-gaff, which
      sprawled carelessly where it had fallen when the halyards were let run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter is below, there,&rdquo; explained Captain Candage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vacation trip, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think it can be called that, Captain Lougee,&rdquo; stated the host,
      dryly. &ldquo;She is having about as good a time as a canary-bird would have in
      a corn-popper over a hot fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she come for, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made her come. I shanghaied her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's no way to treat wimmen folks,&rdquo; declared Captain Lougee. &ldquo;I've
      raised five daughters and I know what I'm talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you have raised five girls, and they're smart as tophet and right
      as a trivet&mdash;and that's why I have grabbed right in on the subject as
      I have. I was glad to see you coming aboard, Captain Lougee. I want some
      advice from a man who knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'm the man to ask, Captain Candage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last time I was home&mdash;where she has been living with her Aunt Zilpah&mdash;I
      ketched her!&rdquo; confessed Candage. His voice was hoarse. His fingers, bent
      and calloused with rope-pulling, trembled as he fingered the seam of his
      trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't tell!&rdquo; Lougee clucked, solicitously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I ketched her buggy-riding!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there was a gang of 'em in a beach-wagon. They was going to a party.
      And I ketched her dancing with a fellow at that party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go ahead now that you've got started! Shake out the mainsail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's about all there is to it&mdash;except that a fellow has been
      beauing her home from Sunday-school concerts with a lantern. Yes, I reckon
      that is about all to date and present writing,&rdquo; confessed Candage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else do you suspect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. Of course, there's no telling what it will grow to be&mdash;with
      dudes a-pestering her the way they do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain't any telling about anything in this world, is there?&rdquo; demanded
      Captain Lougee, very sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon not&mdash;not for sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that because your girl&mdash;like any girl should&mdash;has
      been having a little innocent fun with young folks, you have dragged her
      on board this old hooker, shaming her and making her ridiculous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been trying to do my duty as a father,&rdquo; stated Captain Candage,
      stoutly, and avoiding the flaming gaze of his guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lougee straightened his leg so as to come at his trousers pocket,
      produced a plug of tobacco, and gnawed a chew off a corner, after careful
      inspection to find a likely spot for a bite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need to have something in my mouth about this time&mdash;something
      soothing to the tongue and, as you might say, sort of confining, so that
      too much language won't bu'st out all at once,&rdquo; he averred, speaking with
      effort as he tried to lodge the huge hunk of tobacco into a comfortable
      position. &ldquo;I have raised five nice girls, and I have always treated 'em as
      if they had common sense along with woman's nat'ral goodness and
      consid'able more self-reliance than a Leghorn pullet. And I used 'em like
      they had the ordinary rights and privileges of human beings. And they are
      growed up and a credit to the family. And I haven't got to look back over
      my record and reflect that I was either a Chinyman or a Turkeyman. No,
      sir! I have been a father&mdash;and my girls can come and sit on my knee
      to-day and get my advice, and think it's worth something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and walked toward his dory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But hold on,&rdquo; called Captain Candage. &ldquo;You haven't told me what you
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't I? I thought I had, making it mild and pleasant. But if you need
      a little something more plain and direct, I'll remark&mdash;still making
      it mild and pleasant&mdash;that you're a damned old fool! And now I'll go
      back and be sociable with them fish scraps. I believe they will smell
      better after this!&rdquo; He leaped into his dory and rowed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage offered no rejoinder to that terse and meaty summing up.
      Naturally, he was as ready with his tongue as Captain Ranse Lougee or any
      other man alongshore. But in this case the master of the <i>Polly</i> was
      not sure of his ground. He knew that Captain Lougee had qualified as
      father of five. In the judgment of a mariner experience counts. And he did
      not resent the manner of Captain Lougee because that skipper's brutal
      bluntness was well known by his friends. Captain Candage had asked and he
      had received. He rested his elbows on his knees and stared after the
      departing caller and pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe he is right. He probably <i>is</i> right. But it wouldn't be
      shipboard discipline if I told her that I have been wrong. I reckon I'll
      go aft and be pleasant and genteel, hoping that nothing will happen to
      rile my feelings. Now that my feelings are calm and peaceful, and having
      taken course and bearings from a father of five, I'll probably say to her,
      'You'd better trot along home, sissy, seeing that I have told you how to
      mind your eye after this.'&rdquo;

      IV ~ OVER THE &ldquo;POLLY'S&rdquo; RAIL
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     O Stormy was a good old man!
     To my way you storm along!
     Physog tough as an old tin pan,
     Ay, ay, ay, Mister Storm-along!
             &mdash;Storm-along Shanty.
</pre>
    <p>
      Without paying much attention to the disturber, Captain Candage had been a
      bit nettled during his meditation. A speed boat from one of the yachts
      kept circling the <i>Polly</i>, carrying a creaming smother of water under
      its upcocked bow. It was a noisy gnat of a boat and it kicked a
      contemptuous wake against the rust-streaked old wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it swept under the counter, after Captain Candage was back on his
      quarter-deck, he gave it a stare over the rail, and his expression was
      distinctly unamiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They probably wasted more money on that doostra-bulus than this schooner
      would sell for in the market today,&rdquo; he informed Otie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don't care how money goes so long as they didn't have to sweat
      earning it. Slinging it like they'd sling beans!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Back on its circling course swished the darting tender. This time the
      purring motor whined into silence and the boat came drifting alongside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On board <i>Polly!</i>&rdquo; hailed one of the yachtsmen, a man with owner's
      insignia on his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master of the old schooner stuck his lowering visage farther over the
      rail, but he did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't this <i>Polly</i> the real one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it's only a chromo painting of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you! You're a gentleman!&rdquo; snapped the yachtsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hold on, Paul,&rdquo; urged one of the men in the tender. &ldquo;There's a right
      way to handle these old boys.&rdquo; He stood up. &ldquo;We're much interested in this
      packet, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's why you have been making a holy show of her, playing ring around a
      rosy, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me, isn't this the old shallop that was a privateer in the war
      of eighteen twelve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody aboard here has ever said she wasn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, may we not come on board and look her over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No sir, you can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, look here, captain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm looking!&rdquo; declared the master of the <i>Polly</i> in ominous tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't mean to annoy you, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folks who don't know any better do a lot of things without meaning to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage regularly entertained a sea-toiler's resentment for men
      who used the ocean as a mere playground. But more especially, during those
      later days, his general temper was touchy in regard to dapper young men,
      for he had faced a problem of the home which had tried his soul. He felt
      an unreasoning choler rising in him in respect to these chaps, who seemed
      to have no troubles of their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a writer,&rdquo; explained the other. &ldquo;If I may be allowed on board I'll
      take a few pictures and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And make fun of me and my bo't by putting a piece in the paper to tickle
      city dudes. Fend off!&rdquo; he commanded, noticing that the tender was drifting
      toward the schooner's side and that one of the crew had set a boat-hook
      against the main chain-plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't bother with the old crab,&rdquo; advised the owner, sourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the other persisted, courteously, even humbly. &ldquo;I am afraid you do not
      understand me, captain. I would as soon make jest of my mother as of this
      noble old relic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead! Call it names!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am taking off my hat to it,&rdquo; he declared, whipping his cap from his
      head. &ldquo;My father's grandfather was in the war of eighteen twelve. I want
      to honor this old patriot here with the best tribute my pen can pay. If
      you will allow me to come on board I shall feel as though I were stepping
      upon a sacred spot, and I can assure you that my friends, here, have just
      as much respect for this craft as I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this honest appeal did not soften Captain Candage. He did not
      understand exactly from what source this general rancor of his flowed. At
      the same time he was conscious of the chief reason why he did not want to
      allow these visitors to rummage aboard the schooner. They would meet his
      daughter, and he was afraid, and he was bitterly ashamed of himself
      because he was afraid. Dimly he was aware that this everlasting fear on
      her account constituted an insult to her. The finer impulse to protect her
      privacy was not actuating him; he knew that, too. He was merely foolishly
      afraid to trust her in the company of young men, and the combination of
      his emotions produced the simplest product of mental upheaval&mdash;unreasonable
      wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fend off, I say,&rdquo; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again I beg you, captain, with all respect, please may we come on board?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You get away from here and tend to your own business, if you've got any,
      or I'll heave a bunch of shingles at you!&rdquo; roared the skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; The voice expressed indignant reproof. &ldquo;Father, I am ashamed of
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl came to the rail, and the yachtsmen stared at her as if she were
      Aphrodite risen from the sea instead of a mighty pretty girl emerging from
      a dark companion-way. She had appeared so suddenly! She was so manifestly
      incongruous in her surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother o' mermaids!&rdquo; muttered the yacht-owner in the ear of the man
      nearest. &ldquo;Is the old rat still privateering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men in the tender stood up and removed their caps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have insulted these gentlemen, father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage knew it, and that fact did not soften his anger in the
      least. At the same time this appearance of his own daughter to read him a
      lesson in manners in public was presumption too preposterous to be
      endured; her daring gave him something tangible for his resentment to
      attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned on her. &ldquo;You go below where you belong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I belong up here just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down below with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll not go until you apologize to these gentlemen, father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't ashore now, miss, to tell me when to wipe my feet and not muss
      the tidies! You're on the high seas, and I'm cap'n of this vessel. Below,
      I say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These gentlemen know the <i>Polly</i>, and they will find out the name of
      the man who commands her, and I don't propose to have it said that the
      Candages are heathens,&rdquo; she declared, firmly. &ldquo;If you do not apologize,
      father, I shall apologize for you.&rdquo; She tried to crowd past him to the
      rail, but he clapped his brown hand over her mouth and pushed her back.
      His natural impulse as commander of his craft dominated his feelings as a
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll teach ye shipboard discipline, Polly Candage,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;even if
      I have to take ye acrost my knee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on there, if you please, captain,&rdquo; called the spokesman of the
      yachtsmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage was hustling his daughter toward the companionway. But
      there was authority in the tone, and he paused and jutted a challenging
      chin over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have any of you critters got to say about my private business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The formality of the man in the tender was a bit exaggerated in his reply.
      &ldquo;Only this, sir. We are going away at once before we bring any more
      trouble upon this young lady, to whom we tender our most respectful
      compliments. We do not know any other way of helping her. Our protests,
      being the protests of gentlemen, might not be able to penetrate; it takes
      a drill to get through the hide of a rhinoceros!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The skipper of the <i>Polly</i> did not trouble himself about the finer
      shadings in that little speech, but of one fact he felt sure: he had been
      called a rhinoceros. He released his daughter, yanked the marlinespike
      away from Otie, who had been holding himself in the background as a
      reserve force, and stamped to the rail. He poised his weapon, fanning it
      to and fro to take sure aim. But the engineer had thrown in his clutch and
      the speed boat foamed off before the captain got the range, and he was too
      thrifty to heave a perfectly good marlinespike after a target he could not
      hit, angry as he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl faced her father. There was no doubting her mood. She was a
      rebel. Indignation set up its flaming standards on her cheeks, and the
      signal-flames of combat sparkled in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you dare to do such a thing to me&mdash;those gentlemen looking
      on? Father, have you lost your mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Otie expressed the opinion tinder his breath that the captain, on the
      contrary, had &ldquo;lost his number.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Otie's superior officer was stamping around the quarterdeck, kicking at
      loose objects, and avoiding his daughter's resentful gaze. There was a
      note of insincerity in his bluster, as if he wanted to hide embarrassment
      in a cloud of his own vaporings, as a squid colors water when it fears
      capture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After this you call me Cap'n Candage,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;After this I'm
      Cap'n Candage on the high seas, and I propose to run my own quarter-deck.
      And when I let a crowd of dudes traipse on board here to peek and spy and
      grin and flirt with you, you'll have clamshells for finger-nails. Now, my
      lady, I don't want any back talk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am going to talk to you, father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember that I'm a Candage, and back talk&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I a Candage&mdash;and I have just been ashamed of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to have discipline on my own quarterdeck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back talk, quarter-deck discipline, calling you captain! Fol-de-rol and
      fiddlesticks! I'm your own daughter and you're my father. And you have
      brought us both to shame! There! I don't want to stay on this old hulk,
      and I'm not going to stay. I am going home to Aunt Zilpah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had made up my mind to let you go. My temper was mild and sweet till
      those jeehoofered, gold-trimmed sons of a striped&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had made up my mind to let you go. But I ain't going to give in to a
      mutiny right before the face and eyes of my own crew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smut-nosed Dolph had arrived with the supper-dishes balanced in his arms
      while he crawled over the deckload. He was listening with the utmost
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Aunt Zilpah has aided and abetted you in your flirting,&rdquo; raged the
      captain. &ldquo;My own sister, taking advantage of my being off to sea trying to
      earn money&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to insult everybody in this world, father? I shall go home, I
      say. I'm miserable here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see to it that you ain't off gamboling and galley-westing with
      dudes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her spirit the girl was not able to bandy retort longer with
      this hard-shelled mariner, whose weapon among his kind for years had been
      a rude tongue. Shocked grief put an end to her poor little rebellion.
      Tears came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are giving these two men a budget to carry home and spread about the
      village! Oh, father, you are wicked&mdash;wicked!&rdquo; She put her hands to
      her face, sobbed, and then ran away down into the gloomy cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence on the quarter-deck. Otie recovered his
      marlinespike and began to pound the eye-bolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without presuming, preaching, or poking into things that ain't none of my
      business, I want to say that I don't blame you one mite, cap'n,&rdquo; he
      volunteered. &ldquo;No matter what she says, she wasn't to be trusted among them
      dudes on shore, and I speak from observation and, being an old bach, I can
      speak impartial. The dudes on the water is just as bad. Them fellows were
      flirting with her all the time they was 'longside. Real men that means
      decent ain't called on to keep whisking their caps off and on all the time
      a woman is in sight&mdash;and I see one of 'em wink at her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage was in a mood to accept this comfort from Oakum Otie, and
      to put out of his contrite conscience the memory of what Captain Ranse
      Lougee had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you worry! I've got her now where I can keep my eye on her, and I'm
      cap'n of my own vessel&mdash;don't nobody ever forget that!&rdquo; He shook his
      fist at the gaping cook. &ldquo;What ye standing there for, like a hen-coop with
      the door open and letting my vittels cool off? Hiper your boots! Down
      below with you and dish that supper onto the table!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The skipper lingered on deck, his hand at his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fog was settling over the inner harbor. In the dim vastness seaward a
      steamer was hooting. Each prolonged blast, at half-minute intervals,
      sounded nearer. The sound was deep, full-toned, a mighty diapason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What big fellow can it be that's coming in here?&rdquo; the captain grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most likely only another tin skimmer of a yacht,&rdquo; suggested the mate,
      tossing the eye-splice and the marline-spike into the open hatch of the
      lazaret. &ldquo;You know what they like to do, them play-critters! They stick on
      a whistle that's big enough for Seguin fog-horn.&rdquo; He squinted under the
      edge of his palm and waited. &ldquo;There she looms. What did I tell ye? Nothing
      but a yacht.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she's a bouncer,&rdquo; remarked the skipper. &ldquo;What do you make her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&mdash;L,&rdquo; spelled Otie&mdash;&ldquo;O&mdash;L&mdash;<i>Olenia</i>. Must be a
      local pilot aboard. None of them New York spiffer captains could find
      Saturday Cove through the feather-tide that's outside just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whether they can or whether they can't isn't of any interest to
      me,&rdquo; stated the skipper, with fine indifference. &ldquo;I'd hate to be in a
      tight place and have to depend on one of them gilded dudes! I smell
      supper. Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a little uncertain as to what demeanor he ought to assume below,
      but he clumped down the companion-way with considerable show of
      confidence, and Otie followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain cast a sharp glance at his daughter. He had been afraid that
      he would find her crying, and he did not know how to handle such cases
      with any certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had dried her eyes and she gave him no very amiable look&mdash;rather,
      she hinted defiance. He felt more at ease. In his opinion, any person who
      had spirit enough left for fight was in a mood to keep on enjoying life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I went a mite too far, Polly,&rdquo; he admitted. He was mild, but he
      preserved a little touch of surliness in order that she might not conclude
      that her victory was won. &ldquo;But seeing that I brought you off to sea to get
      you away from flirting&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you dare to say that about me!&rdquo; She beat her round little fist on
      the table. &ldquo;Don't you dare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean that you ever done it! The dudes done it! I want to do right
      by you, Polly. I've been to sea so long that I don't know much about ways
      and manners, I reckon. I can't get a good line on things as I ought to.
      I'm an old fool, I reckon.&rdquo; His voice trembled. &ldquo;But it made me mad to
      have you stram up there on deck and call me names before 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always worked hard for you&mdash;sailing the seas and going
      without things myself, so that you could have 'em&mdash;doing the best I
      could ever after your poor mother passed on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am grateful to you, father. But you don't understand a girl&mdash;oh,
      you don't understand! But let's not talk about it any more&mdash;not now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't saying to-night&mdash;I ain't making promises! But maybe&mdash;we'll
      see how things shape up&mdash;maybe I'll send you back home. Maybe it 'll
      be to-morrow. We'll see how the stage runs to the train, and so forth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to leave it all to you, father. I'm sure you mean to do
      right.&rdquo; She served the food as mistress at the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems homelike with you here,&rdquo; said Captain Can-dage, meekly and
      wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will stay with you, father, if it will make you happier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sha'n't listen to anything of the sort. It ain't no place aboard here
      for a girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the open port they heard the frequent clanging of the
      steam-yacht's engine-room bell and the riot of her swishing screws as she
      eased herself into an anchorage. She was very near them&mdash;so near that
      they could hear the chatter of the voices of gay folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What boat is that, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another frosted-caker! I can't remember the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the <i>Oilyena</i> or something like that. I forget fancy names
      pretty quick,&rdquo; Otie informed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it ain't much use to load your mind down with that kind of sculch,&rdquo;
       stated Captain Candage, poising a potato on his fork-tines and peeling it,
      his elbows on the table. &ldquo;That yacht and the kind of folks that's aboard
      that yacht ain't of any account to folks like us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The memory of some remarks which are uttered with peculiar fervor remains
      with the utterer. Some time later&mdash;long after&mdash;Captain Candage
      remembered that remark and informed himself that, outside of weather
      predictions, he was a mighty poor prophet.

      V ~ ON THE BRIDGE OF YACHT &ldquo;<i>OLENIA</i>&rdquo;
     </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     O the times are hard and the wages low,
          Leave her, bullies, leave her!
     I guess it's time for us to go,
          It's time for us to leave her.
                  &mdash;Across the Western Ocean.
</pre>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo was not finding responsibility his chief worry while the <i>Olenia</i>
      was making port.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a real mariner's job to drive her through the fog, stab the harbor
      entrance, and hunt out elbow-room for her in a crowded anchorage. But all
      that was in the line of the day's work. While he watched the compass,
      estimated tide drift, allowed for reduced speed, and listened for the
      echoes which would tell him his distance from the rocky shore, he was
      engaged in the more absorbing occupation of canvassing his personal
      affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the hired master of a private yacht he might have overlooked that
      affront from the owner, even though it was delivered to a captain on the
      bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      But love has a pride of its own. He had been abused like a lackey in the
      hearing of Alma Marston. It was evident that the owner had not finished
      the job. Mayo knew that he had merely postponed his evil moment by sending
      back a reply which would undoubtedly seem like insubordination in the
      judgment of a man who did not understand ship discipline and etiquette of
      the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that Marston intended to call him &ldquo;upon the carpet&rdquo; on the
      quarter-deck as soon as the yacht was anchored, and proposed to continue
      that insulting arraignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his new pride, in the love which now made all other matters of life so
      insignificant, Mayo was afraid of himself; he knew his limitations in the
      matter of submission; even then he felt a hankering to walk aft and jounce
      Julius Marston up and down in his hammock chair. He did not believe he
      could stand calmly in the presence of Alma Marston and listen to any
      unjust berating, even from her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to put his flaming resentment out of his thoughts, but he could
      not. In the end, he told himself that perhaps it was just as well! Alma
      Marston must have pride of her own. She could not continue to love a man
      who remained in the position of her father's hireling; she would surely be
      ashamed of a lover who was willing to hump his back and take a lashing in
      public. His desire to be with her, even at the cost of his pride, was
      making him less a man and he knew it. He decided to face Marston, man
      fashion, and then go away. He felt that she would understand in spite of
      her grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning from a look at the compass, he saw that the yacht's owner
      was on the bridge. Half of an un-lighted cigar, which was soggy with the
      dampness of the fog, plugged Marston's-mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He scowled when the captain saluted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't bother to talk now,&rdquo; the millionaire broke in when Mayo began
      an explanation of his delay in obeying the call to the quarter-deck. &ldquo;When
      I have anything to say to a man I want his undivided attention. Is this
      fog going to hold on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, until the wind hauls more to the norrard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then anchor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am heading into Saturday Cove now, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anchor here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm looking for considerably more than a capful of wind when it comes,
      sir. It isn't prudent to anchor offshore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marston grunted and turned away. He stood at the end of the bridge,
      chewing on the cigar, until the <i>Olenia</i> was in the harbor with
      mudhook set. Mayo twitched the jingle bell, signaling release to the
      engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at your service, sir,&rdquo; he reported, walking to the owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marston rolled the plugging cigar to a corner of his mouth and inquired,
      &ldquo;Now, young man, tell me what you mean by saluting a Bee line steamer with
      my whistle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not salute the <i>Conomo</i>, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gave her three whistles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're on a gentleman's yacht now, young man, and not on a
      fishing-steamer. Yachting etiquette doesn't allow a steam-whistle to be
      sounded in salute. Mr. Beveridge has just looked it up for me, and I know,
      and you need not assume any of your important knowledge.&rdquo; Marston seemed
      to be displaying much more irritation than a small matter warranted. But
      what he added afforded more light on the subject. &ldquo;The manager of the Bee
      line was on board that steamer. You heard him hoot that siren at me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard him give me cross-signals in defiance of the rules of the road,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you know that he whistled at me as an insult&mdash;as a sneer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard only ordinary signals, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is ordinary to a sailor's observation! You allowed him to
      crowd you off your course. You made a spectacle of my yacht, splashing it
      around like a frightened duck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was avoiding collision, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have made your bigness with my yacht! You sneaked and dodged
      like a fishing-boat skipper. Was it on a fishing-boat you were trained to
      those tricks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have commanded a fishing-steamer, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On top of it all you gave him three whistles&mdash;regular fishing-boat
      manners, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo straightened and his face and eyes expressed the spirit of a
      Yankee skipper who knew that he was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; insisted Marston, &ldquo;that you saluted him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I say, sir, that he cross-signaled, an offense that has lost masters
      their licenses. When I was pinched I gave him three whistles to say that
      my engines were going full speed astern. If Mr. Beveridge had looked
      farther in that book he might have found that rule, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I looked up at the bridge, here, you were waving your hand to him&mdash;three
      whistles and a hand-wave! You can't deny that you were saluting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was shaking my fist at him, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Within himself Captain Mayo was frankly wondering because the owner of the
      <i>Olenia</i> was displaying all this heat. He remembered the taunt from
      the pilot-house of the <i>Conomo</i> and understood vaguely that there
      were depths in the affair which he had not fathomed. But he was in no mood
      to atone vicariously for the offenders aboard the <i>Conomo</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could have found a New York captain who knew the short cuts along
      this coast I could have had some decency and dignity on board my yacht.
      I'm even forgetting my own sense of what is proper&mdash;out here wasting
      words and time in this fashion. You're all of the same breed, you
      down-easters!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite sure you can find a New York captain&mdash;&rdquo; began Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want your opinion in regard to my business, young man. When I
      need suggestions from you I'll ask for them.&rdquo; He flung his soggy cigar
      over the rail and went down the ladder, and the fog closed immediately
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo paced the bridge. He was alone there. A deck-hand had hooded
      the brass of the binnacle and search-light, listening while the owner had
      called the master to account. Mayo knew that the full report of that
      affair would be carried to the forecastle. His position aboard the yacht
      had become intolerable. He wondered how much Marston would say aft. His
      cheeks were hot and rancor rasped in his thoughts. In the hearing of the
      girl he adored his shortcomings would be the subject for a few moments of
      contemptuous discourse, even as the failings of cooks form a topic for
      idle chatter at the dinner-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the blank silence of the wrapping fog came many sounds. Noises
      carried far and the voice of an unseen singer, who timed himself to the
      clank of an Apple-treer pump, brought to Mayo the words of an old shanty:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Come all you young fellows that follow the sea,
       Now pray pay attention and lis-ten to me.
          O blow the man down, bullies, blow the man down!
          Way-ay, blow the man down.
       O blow the man down in Liverpool town!
       Give me some time to blow the man down.
       'Twas aboard a Black-Bailer I first served my time,
       And in that Black-Bailer I wasted my prime.
       'Tis larboard and starboard on deck you will sprawl,
       For blowers and strikers command the Black Ball.
            So, it's blow the man down, bullies&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Alma Marston's voice interrupted his somber appreciation of the
      significance of that ditty. &ldquo;Are you up there, Boyd?&rdquo; she asked, in
      cautious tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurried to the head of the ladder and saw her at its foot, half hidden
      in the mists even at that short distance. He reached down his hand and she
      came up, grasping it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was studying his expression with both eagerness and apprehension. &ldquo;I
      couldn't stay away from you any longer,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;The fog is good to
      us! Father could not see me as I came forward. I must tell you, Boyd. He
      has ordered me to stay aft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he dared to say to you what he has been saying below about you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think it needed any especial daring on your father's part; I am
      only his servant,&rdquo; he said, with bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he&mdash;he insulted you like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose your father did not look on what he said as insult. I repeat, I
      am a paid servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what you did was right! I know it must have been right, for you know
      everything about what is right to do on the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand my duties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he blamed you for something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a bit worse than that from my viewpoint.&rdquo; He smiled down at her,
      for her eyes were searching his face as if appealing for a bit of
      consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boyd, don't mind him,&rdquo; she entreated. &ldquo;Somebody who has been fighting him
      in business has been very naughty. I don't know just what it's all about.
      But he has so many matters to worry him. And he snaps at me just the same,
      every now and then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, some men are cowards enough to abuse those who must look to them for
      the comforts of this world,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must make allowances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll not stay in a position where a man who hires me thinks he can talk
      to me as if I were a foremast hand. Alma, you would despise me if I
      allowed myself to be kicked around like a dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would love you all the more for being willing to sacrifice something
      for my sake. I want you here&mdash;here with all your love&mdash;here with
      me as long as these summer days last.&rdquo; She patted his cheek. &ldquo;Why don't
      you tell me that you want to stay with me, Boyd? That you will die if we
      cannot be together? We can see each other here. I can bring Nan Burgess on
      the bridge with me. Father will not mind then. Let each day take care of
      itself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to be what you want me to be&mdash;to do what you want me to do.
      But I wish you would tell me to go out into the world and make something
      of myself. Alma, tell me to go! And wait for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid her face against his shoulder and reached for his fingers,
      endeavoring to pull one of his arms about her. But both of his hands were
      clutching the rail of the bridge. He resisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to be like all the rest? Just money and trouble and worry?&rdquo;
       She stretched up on tiptoe and brushed a kiss across his fog-wet cheek.
      &ldquo;Are you asleep, my big boy? Yesterday you were awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I am really awake to-day, and that I was dreaming yesterday.
      Alma, I cannot sneak behind your father's back to make love to you. I
      can't do it. I'm going to give up this position. I can't endure it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say 'No!' I need you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll not give you up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something dramatic in her declaration; her demeanor expressed
      the placid calm of absolute proprietorship. She worked his unwilling
      fingers free from the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you because you can forget yourself. Now don't be like all the
      others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He realized that a queer little sting of impatience was pricking him. The
      girl did not seem to understand what his manhood was prompting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't be selfish, Boyd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put into words the vague thought which had been troubling him in
      regard to her attitude; and now that he understood what his thought had
      been he was incensed by what seemed his own disloyalty. And yet, the girl
      was asking him to make over his nature!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid it's all wrong. These things never seem to come out right,&rdquo; he
      mourned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are trying to turn the world upside down all at once&mdash;and all
      alone. Don't think so much, you solemn Yankee. Just love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his aims about her. &ldquo;I'm sailing in new waters. I don't seem to
      know the true course or the right bearings!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's stay anchored until the fog lifts! Isn't that what sailors usually
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He confessed it, kissing her when she lifted her tantalizing face from his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you'll let the future alone, won't you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; But even while he promised he was obliged to face that future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julius Marston, at the foot of the ladder, called to his daughter. &ldquo;Are
      you up there?&rdquo; he demanded, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave her lover a hasty caress and obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo was obliged to listen. Marston, in his anger, showed no
      consideration for possible eavesdroppers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you to stay aft where you belong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, father, I don't understand why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are my orders! I understand. <i>You</i> don't need to understand.
      This world is full of cheap fellows who misinterpret actions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo grasped the rails of the bridge ladder and did down to the
      deck without touching his feet to the treads. He appeared before the
      father and daughter with startling suddenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Marston, I am leaving my position on board here as soon as you can
      get another man to take my place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You signed papers for the season. It is not convenient for me to make a
      change.&rdquo; Marston spoke with the crispness of a man who had settled the
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo was conscious that the girl was trying to attract his gaze,
      but he kept his eyes resolutely from her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insist on being relieved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no patience with childishness in a man! I found it necessary to
      reprimand you. You'll probably know your place after this.&rdquo; He turned
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have decided that I do not belong on this yacht,&rdquo; stated Mayo, with an
      emphasis he knew the girl would understand. &ldquo;You must get another master!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot pick captains out of this fog, and I allow no man to tell me my
      own business. I shall keep you to your written agreement. Hold yourself in
      readiness to carry telegrams ashore for me. I take it there is an office
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is, sir,&rdquo; returned Mayo, stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, departing, bestowed on him a pretty grimace of triumph, plainly
      rejoicing because his impetuous resignation had been overruled so
      autocratically. But Mayo gave a somber return to the raillery of her eyes.
      He had spoken out to Marston as a man, and had been treated with the
      contemptuous indifference which would be accorded to a bond-servant. He
      was wounded by the light manner in which she viewed that affront, even
      though her own father offered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood there alone for a time, meditating various rash acts. But under
      all the tumult of his feelings was the realization that the responsibility
      for that yacht's discipline and safety rested on his shoulders and he went
      about his duties. He called two of the crew and ordered the gangway steps
      down and the port dinghy cleared and lowered. Then he went to the
      chart-room and sat on a locker and tried to figure out whether he was
      wonderfully happy or supremely miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marston promptly closeted himself with his three wise men of business
      after he went aft. &ldquo;We'll frame up those telegrams now and get them off,&rdquo;
       he told them. &ldquo;I thought I'd better wait until I had worked the bile out
      of my system. Never try to do sane and safe business when you're angry,
      gentlemen! I'm afraid those telegrams would not have been exactly coherent
      if I had written them right after that Bee liner smashed past us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been ready to believe that Tucker would come in with us on the
      right lay,&rdquo; said one of the associates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; agreed Marston. &ldquo;I have thought all his loud talk has been
      bluff to beat up a bigger price. But, after what he did to-day! Oh no! He
      is out to fight and he grabbed his chance to show us! I do not believe a
      lot of this regular fight talk. But when a man comes up and smashes me
      between the eyes I begin to suspect his intentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no need of dickering with him any longer, Mr. Marston. He made
      his work as dirty as he could to-day&mdash;he has left nothing open to
      doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; said another of the group. &ldquo;Tucker has let himself get ugly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; replied Marston, dryly. &ldquo;And I'm growing senile, too, I'm
      afraid. I went forward and wasted as much anathema on that skipper of mine
      as I would use up in putting through a half-million deal with an
      opposition traffic line. Next thing I know I'll be arguing with, the
      smoke-stack. But I must confess, gentlemen, that Tucker rather took my
      breath away to-day. Either he has become absolutely crazy or else he
      doesn't understand the strength of the combination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn't waked up yet. He doesn't know what's against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be our fault, in a measure,&rdquo; stated one of the men. &ldquo;We haven't
      been able to let men like Tucker in on the full details.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In business it's the good guesser who wins,&rdquo; declared Marston. &ldquo;Our
      merger isn't a thing to be advertised. And if we do any more explaining to
      Tucker the whole plan <i>will</i> be advertised, you can depend on it. The
      infernal fool has been holding us up three months, demanding more
      knowledge&mdash;and he can't be trusted. There's only one thing to do,
      gentlemen! That!&rdquo; He drove his fist into his palm with significant thud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the Bee line absolutely essential in our plans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every line along this coast is essential in making that merger stock an
      air-tight proposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a new line and is not paying dividends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for that matter, it's got nothing in that respect on some of the
      other lines we're salting down in the merger,&rdquo; suggested a member of the
      party, speaking for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid you said it then, Thompson! American bottoms seem to be turned
      into barnacle-gardens,&rdquo; declared the man who had questioned the matter of
      Tucker's value.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, just a moment!&rdquo; Julius Marston leaned forward in his chair.
      His voice was low. His eyes narrowed. He dominated them by his
      earnestness. &ldquo;You have followed me in a number of enterprises, and we have
      had good luck. But let me tell you that we have ahead of us the biggest
      thing yet, and we cannot afford to leave one loose end! Not one,
      gentlemen! That's why a fool like Tucker doesn't deserve any consideration
      when he gets in our way. Listen to me! The biggest thing that has ever
      happened in this world is going to happen. How do I know? I am not sure
      that I do know. But as I have just told you, the man who guesses right is
      the winner.&rdquo; His thin nose was wrinkled, and the strip of beard on his
      chin bristled. Sometimes men called Marston &ldquo;the fox of Wall Street.&rdquo; He
      suggested the reason for his nickname as he sat there and squinted at his
      associates. &ldquo;And there's an instinct that helps some men to guess right.
      Something is going to happen in this world before long that will make
      millionaires over and over out of men who have invested a few thousands in
      American bottoms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will happen?&rdquo; bluntly inquired one of the men, after a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am neither clairvoyant nor crystal-gazer,&rdquo; said Marston, grimly. &ldquo;But I
      have led you into some good things when my instinct has whispered. I say
      it's going to happen&mdash;and I say no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make American bottoms worth while the whole of Europe will have to be
      busy doing something else with their ships.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! Then they'll be doing it,&rdquo; returned Marston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have to be a war&mdash;a big war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! Maybe that's the answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there never can be another big war. As a financier you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made some money by adhering to the hard and fast rules of finance.
      But I have made the most of my money by turning my back on those rules and
      listening to my instinct,&rdquo; was Marston's rejoinder. &ldquo;I don't want to
      over-influence you, gentlemen. I don't care to discuss any further what
      you may consider to be dreams. I am not predicting a great war in Europe.
      Common sense argues the other way. But I am going into this ship-merger
      proposition with every ounce of brains and energy and capital I possess.
      The man who gets in my way is trying to keep these two hands of mine off
      millions!&rdquo; He shook his clutched fists above his head. &ldquo;And I'll walk over
      him, by the gods! whether it's Tucker or anybody else. We have had some
      good talks on the subject, first and last. I'm starting now to fight and
      smash opposition. What do you propose to do in the matter, gentlemen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were silent for a time, looking at one another, querying without
      words. Then out of their knowledge of Julius Marston's uncanny abilities,
      remembering their past successes, came resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're in with you to the last dollar,&rdquo; they assured him, one after the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! You're wise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He unlocked a drawer of his desk and secured a code-book. He pressed a
      buzzer and the secretary came hurrying from his stateroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll open action, gentlemen, with a little long-distance skirmish over
      the wire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to dictate his telegrams.

</pre>
    <p>
      The taciturn secretary fumbled his way forward and delivered to Captain
      Mayo a little packet securely bound with tape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orders from Mr. Marston that you take these ashore, yourself. They are
      important telegrams and he wants them hurried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The master called his men to the dinghy, and they rowed him away through
      the fog. It was a touchy job, picking his way through that murk. He stood
      up, leaning forward holding to his taut tiller-ropes, and more by ears
      than his eyes directed his course. A few of the anchored craft, knowing
      that they were in the harbor roadway, clanged their bells lazily once in a
      while. Yacht tenders were making their rounds, carrying parties who were
      paying and returning calls, and these boats were avoiding each other by
      loud hails. Small objects loomed largely and little sounds were
      accentuated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The far voice of an unseen joker announced that he could find his way
      through the fog all right, but was afraid he had not strength enough to
      push his boat through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mayo knew his waters in that harbor, and found his way to the wharf.
      His real difficulties confronted him at the village telegraph office. The
      visiting yachtsmen had flooded the place with messages, and the flustered
      young woman was in a condition nearly resembling hysteria. She was
      defiantly declaring that she would not accept any more telegrams. Instead
      of setting at work upon those already filed she was spending her time
      explaining her limitations to later arrivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo stood at one side and looked on for a few moments. A gentle
      nudge on his elbow called his attention to an elderly man with stringy
      whiskers, who thus solicited his notice. The man held a folded paper
      gingerly by one corner, exhibiting profound respect for his minute burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't one of these yachting dudes&mdash;you're a skipper, ain't you?&rdquo;
       asked the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I can talk to you, as one officer to another&mdash;and glad
      to meet one of my own breed. I'm first mate of the schooner <i>Polly</i>.
      Mr. Speed is my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I need help and advice. This is the first tele-graft I ever had in my
      hands. I'd rather be aholt of an iced halyard in a no'easter! I've been
      sent ashore to telegraft it, and now she says she won't stick it onto the
      wire, however it is they do the blasted trick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo had already noticed that the messengers from the yachts were
      killing time by teasing the flustered young woman; it was good-humored
      badinage, but it was effectively blocking progress at that end of the
      line.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt a &ldquo;native's&rdquo; instinctive impulse to go to the relief of the young
      woman who was being baited by the merrymakers; the responsibility of his
      own errand prompted him to help her clear decks. But he waited, hoping
      that the yachtsmen would go about their business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the <i>Polly</i>, Mr. Speed?&rdquo; he inquired, amiably. &ldquo;Is the Polly in
      the harbor? I didn't notice her in the fog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon you know her, by the way you speak of her,&rdquo; replied the gratified
      Mr. Speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to, sir. She was built at Mayoport by my great-grandfather before
      the Mayo yards began to turn out ships.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I swanny! Be you a Mayo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain bowed and smiled at the enthusiasm displayed by Mr. Speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By ginger! that sort of puts you right into <i>our</i> fambly, so to
      speak!&rdquo; The mate surveyed him with interest and with increasing
      confidence. &ldquo;I'm in a mess, Cap'n Mayo, and I need advice and comfort, I
      reckon. I was headed on a straight tack toward my regular duty, and all of
      a sudden I found myself jibed and in stays, and I'm there now and
      drifting. Seeing that your folks built the <i>Polly</i>, I consider that
      you're in the fambly, and that Proverdunce put you right here to-night in
      this telegraft office. Do you know Cap'n Epps Candage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or his girl, Polly, named for the <i>Polly?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I must confess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it may be just as well for ye that ye don't,&rdquo; said Oakum Otie,
      twisting his straggly beard into a spill and blinking nervously. &ldquo;There I
      was, headed straight and keeping true course, and then she looked at me
      and there was a tremble in her voice and tears in her eyes&mdash;and the
      next thing I knowed I was here in this telegraft place with this!&rdquo; He held
      up the folded paper and his hand shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo did not understand, and therefore he made no remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a song old Ephrum Wack used to sing,&rdquo; went on Mr. Speed,
      getting more confidential and making sure that the other men in the room
      were too much occupied to listen. &ldquo;Chorus went:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;I ain't afeard of the raging sea,
     Nor critters that's in it, whatever they be.
     But a witch of a woman is what skeers me!
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There I've been, standing by Cap'n Epps in the whole dingdo, and she got
      me one side and looked at me and says a few things with a quiver in her
      voice and her eyes all wet and shiny and&rdquo;&mdash;he paused and looked down
      at the paper with bewilderment that was rather pitiful&mdash;&ldquo;and I walked
      right over all common sense and shipboard rules and discipline and
      everything and came here, fetching this to be stuck on to the wire, or
      whatever they do with telegrafts. But,&rdquo; he added, a waver in his tones,
      &ldquo;she is so lord-awful pretty, I couldn't help it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still did Captain Mayo refrain from comment or question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The question now is, had I ought to,&rdquo; demanded Mr. Speed. &ldquo;I'm taking you
      into the fambly on my own responsibility. You're a captain, you're a
      native, and I need good advice. Had I ought to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me, sir. The matter seems to be private,
      and, furthermore, I don't know what you're talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says it's to the milliner so that the milliner will hold the job
      open. But I'm suspicioning that it's roundabout to the beau that's in love
      with her. That's the style of women. Cap'n Epps shanghaied her to get her
      away from that fellow. Now she has got it worked around so that she is
      going back. But there's a beau in it instead of a milliner. She wouldn't
      be so anxious to get word to a milliner. That's my idee, and I reckon it's
      yours, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really have no ideas on the subject,&rdquo; returned Captain Mayo. &ldquo;But if
      you have promised a young lady to send a telegram for her I would
      certainly keep that promise if I were in your place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next moment he regretted his rather impetuous advice, for Mr. Speed
      slapped the paper against a hard palm and blurted out: &ldquo;That's all I
      wanted! Course and bearings from an a-number-one adviser. New, how'll I go
      to work to send this thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been figuring on that matter for the last few minutes, myself,&rdquo;
       acknowledged the captain. &ldquo;It's about time to have a little action in this
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was obliged to elbow his way through the group of men who surrounded
      the telegraph operator. Oakum Otie followed on his heels, resolved to
      study at close range the mystery of telegraphing, realizing what he needed
      for his own instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These telegrams are important and they must go at ore, madam,&rdquo; Mayo
      informed the flustered young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't send them. I am bothered so much I can't do anything,&rdquo; she
      stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, forget your business, skipper,&rdquo; advised one of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not my business, sir.&rdquo; He laid the packet of messages before the
      operator on her little counter and tapped his finger on them. &ldquo;They must
      go,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In their turn,&rdquo; warned the yachtsman, showing that he resented this
      intrusion. &ldquo;And after the party is over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intended to confine my conversation to this young lady,&rdquo; said Mayo. He
      turned and faced them. &ldquo;But I have been here long enough to see that you
      gentlemen are interfering with the business of this office. Perhaps your
      messages are not important. Mine are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The yachtsman was not sober nor was he judicious. &ldquo;Go back to your job,
      young fellow,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;You are horning in among gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; squawked Mr. Speed, with weather eye out for clouds of any
      sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo gave his supporter a glance of mingled astonishment and
      relish. &ldquo;We'd better not have any words about the matter, gentlemen,'' he
      suggested, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; stated the spokesman. &ldquo;If you'll pass on there'll be no
      words&mdash;or anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we'll dispense with words!&rdquo; The quick anger of youth flared in Mayo.
      The air of the man rather than his words had offended deeply. &ldquo;You'd like
      to have this room to yourself so that you can attend to your business, I
      presume?&rdquo; he asked the operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakum Otie laid his folded paper upon the packet of Captain Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will leave the room gentlemen,&rdquo; advised the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Speed thrust out his bony elbows and cracked his hard fists together.
      &ldquo;I have never liked dudes,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;I have been brought up that way.
      All my training with Cap'n Epps has been that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you fit into this thing?&rdquo; demanded one of the yachtsmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About like this,&rdquo; averred Mr. Speed. He grabbed the young man by both
      shoulders and ran him out into the night before anybody could interfere.
      Then Mr. Speed reappeared promptly and inquired, &ldquo;Which one goes next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think they will all go,&rdquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; urged one of the party. &ldquo;We can't afford to get into a brawl
      with natives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet you can't,&rdquo; retorted Oakum Otie. &ldquo;I hain't hove bunches of
      shingles all my life for nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo said nothing more. But after the yachtsmen had looked him over they
      went out, making the affair a subject for ridicule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope I done right and showed to you that I was thankful for good advice,&rdquo;
       suggested Mr. Speed, seeking commendation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a bit hasty, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe, but there's nothing like handing folks a sample just to show up
      the quality of the whole piece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you&mdash;both of you,&rdquo; said the grateful operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better lock your door,&rdquo; advised Mayo. &ldquo;Men are thoughtless when
      they have nothing to do except play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so grateful! And I'm going to break an office rule,&rdquo; volunteered the
      girl. &ldquo;I shall send off your telegrams first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I hope you can tuck that little one in second&mdash;it won't take up
      much room!&rdquo; pleaded Oakum Otie. &ldquo;It's to help an awful pretty girl&mdash;looks
      are a good deal like yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll attend to it,&rdquo; promised the young woman, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside in the village street Mr. Speed wiped his rough palm against the
      leg of his trousers and offered his hand to the captain. &ldquo;I'll have to say
      good-by to you here, sir. I've got a little errunting to do&mdash;fig o'
      terbacker and a box of stror'b'ries. I confess to a terrible tooth for
      stror'b'ries. When the hanker ketches me and I can't get to stror'b'ries
      my stror'b'ry mark shows up behind my ear. I hope I have done right in
      sending off that tele-graft for her&mdash;but it's too bad that a
      landlubber beau is going to get such a pretty girl.&rdquo; Then Oakum Otie
      sighed and melted away into the foggy gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Captain Mayo was half-way down the harbor, on his way back to the
      yacht, he was confronted by a spectacle which startled him. The fog was
      suddenly painted with a ruddy flare which spread high and flamed steadily.
      His first fears suggested that a vessel was on fire. The <i>Olenia</i> lay
      in that direction. He commanded his men to pull hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he burst out of the mists into the zone of the illumination his
      misgivings were allayed, but his curiosity was roused.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dozen yacht tenders flocked in a flotilla near the stern of a rusty old
      schooner. All the tenders were burning Coston lights, and from several
      boats yachtsmen were sending off rockets which striped the pall of fog
      with bizarre colorings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stern of the schooner was well lighted up by the torches, and Mayo saw
      her name, though he did not need that name to assure him of her identity;
      she was the venerable <i>Polly</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light which flamed about her, showing up her rig and lines, was
      weirdly unreal and more than ever did she seem like a ghost ship. The
      thick curtain of the mist caught up the flare of the torches and reflected
      it upon her from the skies, and she was limned in fantastic fashion from
      truck to water-line. Shadows of men in the tenders were thrown against the
      fog-screen in grotesque outline, and a spirit crew appeared to be toiling
      in the top-hamper of the old schooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo ordered his men to hold water and the tender drifted close to
      the flotilla. He spied a yacht skipper whom he had known when both were in
      the coasting trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the idea, Duncan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His acquaintance grinned. &ldquo;Serenade for old Epps Candage's girl&mdash;handed
      to her over his head.&rdquo; He pointed upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Projecting over the schooner's rail was the convulsed countenance of
      Captain Candage. Choler seemed to be consuming him. The freakish light
      painted everything with patterns in arabesque; the captain's face looked
      like the countenance of a gargoyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo, observing with the natural prejudice of a &ldquo;native,&rdquo; detected mockery
      in the affair. He had just been present at one exhibition of the convivial
      humor of larking yachtsmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the special excuse for it?&rdquo; he asked, sourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;According to the story, Epps has brought her with him on this trip to
      break up a courting match.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, does that have anything to do with this performance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's only a little spree,&rdquo; confessed the other. &ldquo;It was planned out
      on our yacht. Old Epps made himself a mucker to-day by sassing some of the
      gents of the fleet, and the boys are handing him a little something.
      That's all! It's only fun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;According to my notion it's the kind of fun that hurts when a girl is
      concerned, Duncan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as serious as ever, eh? Well, my notion is that a little
      good-natured fun never hurts a pretty girl&mdash;and they say this one is
      some looker! Oh, hold on a minute, Boyd!&rdquo; The master of the <i>Olenia</i>
      had turned away and was about to give an order to his oarsmen. &ldquo;You ought
      to stop long enough to hear that new song one of the gents on the <i>Sunbeam</i>
      has composed for the occasion. It's a corker. I heard 'em rehearsing it on
      our yacht.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his impatient resentment on behalf of the daughter of Epps
      Candage, Captain Mayo remained. Just then the accredited minstrel of the
      yachtsmen stood up, balancing himself in a tender. He was clearly revealed
      by the lights, and was magnified by the aureole of tinted fog which
      surrounded him. He sang, in waltz time, in a fine tenor:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Our Polly O,
     O'er the sea you go;
     Fairer than sunbeam, lovely as moon-gleam,
     All of us love thee so!
     While the breezes blow
     To waft thee, Polly O,
     We will be true to thee,
     Crossing the blue to thee,
     Polly&mdash;Polly!
     Dear little Polly,
     Polly&mdash;O-O-O!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He finished the verse and then raised both arms with the gesture of a
      choral conductor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All together, now, boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sang with soul and vigor and excellent effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferocity nearly inarticulate, fury almost apoplectic, were expressed by
      the face above the weather-worn rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say that music soothes the savage breast, but it don't look like it
      in this case,&rdquo; observed Captain Duncan with a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clear off away from here, you drunken dudes! I'll have the law on ye!
      I'll have ye arrested for&mdash;for breaking the peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That threat, considering the surroundings, provoked great hilarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give way all! Here comes a cop!&rdquo; warned a jeering voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's walking on the water,&rdquo; explained another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man must be a fool,&rdquo; declared Captain Mayo. &ldquo;If he'd go below and
      shut up, they'd get tired and leave in a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, Captain Candage seemed to believe that retreat would be greatly
      to his discredit. He continued to hang over the rail, discharging as
      complete a line of deep-water oaths as ever passed the quivering lips of a
      mariner. Therefore the playful yachtsmen were highly entertained and
      stayed to bait him still further. Every little while they sang the Polly
      song with fresh gusto, while the enraged skipper fairly danced to it in
      his mad rage and flung his arms about like a crazy orchestra leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Speed came rowing in his dory, putting out all his strength, splashing
      his oars. &ldquo;My Gawd! Cap'n Mayo,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;I heard 'em hollering 'Oh,
      Polly!' and I was 'feard she was afire. What's the trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better get on board, sir, and induce Captain Candage to go below
      and keep still. He is fast making a complete idiot of himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain't got no influence over him. I ask and implore you to step on
      board and soothe him down, sir. You can do it. He'll listen to a Mayo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd better not try. It's no job for a stranger, Mr. Speed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll be heaving that whole deckload of shingles at 'em next!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get his daughter to coax him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't listen to her when he's that fussed up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry! Give way men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His rowers dropped their oars into the water and pulled away with evident
      reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better stay and see it out,&rdquo; advised Captain Duncan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care much for your show,&rdquo; stated Mayo, curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cabin curtains were drawn on the <i>Olenia</i>, and he felt especially
      shut away from human companionship. He went forward and paced up and down
      the deck, turning over his troubled affairs in his mind, but making poor
      shift in his efforts to set anything in its right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no indications that the serenading yachtsmen were becoming
      tired of their method of killing time during a fog-bound evening. They had
      secured banjos and mandolins, and were singing the Polly song with better
      effect and greater relish. And continually the hoarse voice of the <i>Polly's</i>
      master roared forth malediction, twisted into new forms of profanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Captain Mayo, pacing under the damp gleam of the riding-light, paid
      but little heed to the hullabaloo. He was too thoroughly absorbed in his
      own troubles to feel special interest in what his neighbors were doing. He
      did not even note that a fog-sodden breeze had begun to puff spasmodically
      from the east and that the mists were shredding overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, all of a sudden, a sound forced itself on his attention; he heard
      the chuckling of sheaves and knew that a sail was being hoisted. The
      low-lying stratum of fog was still thick, and he could not perceive the
      identity of the craft which proposed to take advantage of the sluggish
      breeze. The &ldquo;ruckle-ruckle&rdquo; of the blocks sounded at quick intervals and
      indicated haste; there was a suggestion of vicious determination on the
      part of the men who were tugging at the halyards. Then Captain Mayo heard
      the steady clanking of capstan pawls. He knew the methods of the
      Apple-treers, their cautiousness, and their leisurely habits, and he could
      scarcely believe that a coasting skipper was intending to leave the harbor
      that night. But the capstan pawls began to click in staccato, showing that
      the anchor had been broken out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Protesting shouts from all about in the gloom greeted that signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no mistaking the hoarse voice of Captain Candage when it was
      raised in reply; his tones had become familiar after that evening of
      malediction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dingdam ye, I know of a way of getting shet of the bunch of ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't try to shift your anchorage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anchorage be hossified! I'm going to sea!&rdquo; bellowed the master of the <i>Polly</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down with that hook of yours! You'll rake this whole yacht fleet with
      your old dumpcart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have driv' me to it! Now you can take your chances!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next moment Mayo heard the ripping of tackle and a crash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There go two tenders and our boat-boom! Confound it, man, drop your
      hook!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But from that moment Captain Candage, as far as his mouth was concerned,
      preserved ominous silence. The splintery speech of havoc was more
      eloquent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo could not see, but he understood in detail what damage was wrought
      upon the delicate fabric of yachts by that unwieldy old tub of a schooner.
      Here, another boat-boom carried away, as she sluggishly thrust her bulk
      out through the fleet; there an enameled hull raked by her rusty
      chain-plate bolts. Now a tender smashed on the outjutting davits, next a
      wreck of spidery head-rigging, a jib-boom splintered and a foretopmast
      dragged down. If Captain Mayo had been in any doubt as to the details of
      the disasters he would have received full information from the
      illuminating profanity of the victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew well enough that Captain Candage was not performing with wilful
      intent to do all that damage. In what little wind there was the schooner
      was not under control. She was drifting until she got enough headway to be
      steered. In the mean time she was doing what came in her way to do. The <i>Polly</i>
      had been anchored near the <i>Olenia</i>. As soon as her anchor left
      bottom the schooner drifted up the harbor. Mayo knew, in a few minutes,
      that Candage was bringing her about. An especial outbreak of smashing
      signaled that manouver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo sniffed at the breeze, judged distance and direction, and then he
      rushed forward and pounded his fist on the forecastle hatch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rout out all hands!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Rouse up bumpers and tarpaulin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the wind as it was, he realized that the schooner would point up in
      the <i>Olenia</i>'s direction when Candage headed out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Mayo caught a glimpse of her through the fog. His calculation had
      been correct. Headed his way she was. She was moving so slowly that she
      was practically unmanageable; her apple-bows hardly stirred a ripple, but
      with breeze helping the tide-set she was coming irresistibly, paying off
      gradually and promising to sideswipe the big yacht.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo had a mariner's pride in his craft, and a master's devotion to duty.
      He did not content himself with merely ordering about the men who came
      tumbling on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grabbed a huge bumper away from one of the sailors who seemed uncertain
      just what to do; he ran forward and thrust it over the rail, leaning far
      out to see that it was placed properly to take the impact. He was giving
      more attention to the safety of the <i>Olenia</i> than he was to what the
      on-coming <i>Polly</i> might do to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under all bowsprits on schooners, to guy the headstays, thrusts downward a
      short spar, at right angles to the bowsprit; it is called the martingale
      or dolphin-striker. The amateur riggers who had tinkered with the Polly's
      gear in makeshift fashion had not troubled to smooth off spikes with which
      they had repaired the martingale's lower end. Captain Mayo ducked low to
      dodge a guy, and the spikes hooked themselves neatly into the back of his
      reefer coat. Mr. Marston had bought excellent and strong cloth for his
      captain's uniform. The fabric held, the spikes were well set, the <i>Polly</i>
      did not pause, and, therefore, the master of the <i>Olenia</i> was yanked
      off his own deck and went along.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the evening Mayo's collar had been buttoned closely about his neck to
      keep out the fog-damp, and when he was picked up by the spikes the collar
      gripped tightly about his throat and against his larynx. His cry for help
      was only a strangled squawk. His men were scattered along the side of the
      yacht, trying to protect her, the night was over all, and no one noted the
      mode of the skipper's departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old schooner scrunched her way past the <i>Olenia</i>, roweling the
      yacht's glossy paint and smearing her with tar and slime. It was as if the
      rancorous spirit of the unclean had found sudden opportunity to defile the
      clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the <i>Polly</i> passed on into the night with clear pathway to the
      open sea.

      VII ~ INTO THE MESS FROM EASTWARD
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          Farewell to friends, farewell to foes,
          Farewell to dear relations.
          We're bound across the ocean blue&mdash;
          Bound for the foreign nations.
          Then obey your bo's'n's call,
          Walk away with that cat-fall!
     And we'll think on those girls when we can no longer stay.
     And we'll think on those girls when we're far, far away.
                                        &mdash;Unmooring.
</pre>
    <p>
      For the first few moments, after being snatched up in that fashion, Mayo
      hung from the dolphin-striker without motion, like a man paralyzed. He was
      astounded by the suddenness of this abduction. He was afraid to struggle.
      Momentarily he expected that the fabric would let go and that he would be
      rolled under the forefoot of the schooner. Then he began to grow faint
      from lack of breath; he was nearly garroted by his collar. Carefully he
      raised his hands and set them about a stay above his head and lifted
      himself so that he might ease his throat from the throttling grip of the
      collar. He dangled there over the water for some time, feeling that he had
      not strength enough, after his choking, to lift himself into the chains or
      to swing to the foot-rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced up and saw the figurehead; it seemed to be simpering at him
      with an irritating smile. There was something of bland triumph in that
      grin. In the upset of his feelings there was personal and provoking
      aggravation in the expression of the figurehead. He swore at it as if it
      were something human. His anger helped him, gave him strength. He began to
      swing himself, and at last was able to throw a foot over a stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rested for a time and then gave himself another hoist and was able to
      get astride the bowsprit. He judged that they must be outside the headland
      of Saturday Cove, because the breeze was stronger and the sea gurgled and
      showed white threads of foam against the blunt bows. His struggles had
      consumed more time than he had realized in the dazed condition produced by
      his choking collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the popping of a motor-boat's engine far astern, and was cheered
      by the prompt conviction that pursuit was on. Therefore, he made haste to
      get in touch with the <i>Polly's</i> master. He scrambled inboard along
      the bowsprit and fumbled his way aft over the piles of lumber, obliged to
      move slowly for fear of pitfalls, Once or twice he shouted, but he
      received no answer, He perceived three dim figures on the quarter-deck
      when he arrived there&mdash;three men. Captain Candage was stamping to and
      fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who in the devil's name are <i>you?</i>&rdquo; bawled the old skipper. &ldquo;Get
      off'm here! This ain't a passenger-bo't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll get off mighty sudden and be glad to,&rdquo; retorted Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll be hackmetacked!&rdquo; exploded Mr. Speed shoving his face over the
      wheel. &ldquo;It's&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; roared the master. &ldquo;How comes it you're aboard here as a
      stowaway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk foolishness,&rdquo; snapped Captain Mayo &ldquo;Your old martingale spikes
      hooked me up. Heave to and let me off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heave to it is!&rdquo; echoed Oakum Otie, beginning to whirl the tiller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage turned on his mate with the violence of a thunderclap.
      &ldquo;Gad swigger your pelt, who's giving off orders aboard here? Hold on your
      course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; It was a blast of vocal effort. &ldquo;Hold your course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And <i>I</i> say, heave to and let that motor-boat take me off,&rdquo; insisted
      Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage leaned close enough to note the yacht skipper's uniform
      coat. &ldquo;Who do you think you're ordering around, you gilt-striped,
      monkey-doodle dandy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That motor-boat is coming after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think you're of all that importance, hey? No, sir! It's a pack of 'em
      chasing me to make me go back into port and be sued and libeled and
      attached by cheap lawyers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to be seized and libeled! You had no business ratching out of
      that harbor in the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ought to have taken a rising vote of dudes, hey, to find out whether I
      had the right to h'ist my mudhook or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not here to argue. You can do that in court. I tell you to come into
      the wind and wait for that boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better, Cap Candage,&rdquo; bleated Oakum Otie. &ldquo;This is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up! I'm running my own schooner, Mr. Speed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is one of the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care if he is one of the Apostles. I know my own business. Shut
      up! Hold her on her course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took two turns along the quarter-deck, squinting up into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Candage, you and I are going to have a lot of trouble with
      each other if you don't show some common sense. I must get back to my
      yacht.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jump overboard and swim back. I ain't preventing. I didn't ask you on
      board. You can leave when you get ready. But this schooner is bound for
      New York, they're in a hurry for this lumber, and I ain't stopping at way
      stations!&rdquo; He took another look at the weather, licked his thumb, and held
      it against the breeze. &ldquo;Sou'west by sou', and let her run! And shut up!&rdquo;
       he commanded his mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo grabbed one of the yawl davits and sprang to the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're some bigger than a needle, but so long as the haystack stays thick
      enough I guess we needn't worry!&rdquo; remarked Captain Candage, cocking his
      ear to listen to the motor-boat's exhaust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoi-oi!&rdquo; shouted Mayo into the night astern. He knew that men hear
      indistinctly over the noise of a gasoline-engine, but he had resolved to
      keep shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, men! This way with that boat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Vast heaving on that howl!&rdquo; commanded Candage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mayo persisted with all his might. His attention was confined wholly
      to his efforts, and he was not prepared for the sudden attack from behind.
      The master of the <i>Polly</i> seized Mayo's legs and yanked him backward
      to the deck. The young man fell heavily, and his head thumped the planks
      with violence which flung him into insensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he opened his eyes he looked up and saw a hanging-lamp that creaked
      on its gimbals as it swayed to the roll of the schooner. He was in the <i>Polly's</i>
      cabin. Next he was conscious that he was unable to move. He was seated on
      the floor, his back against a stanchion, his hands lashed behind him by
      bonds which confined him to the upright support. But the most
      uncomfortable feature of his predicament was a marlinespike which was
      stuck into his mouth like a bit provided for a fractious horse, and was
      secured by lashings behind his head. He was effectually gagged.
      Furthermore, the back of his head ached in most acute fashion. He rolled
      his eyes about and discovered that he had a companion in misery. A very
      pretty young woman was seated on a camp-chair across the cabin. Her face
      expressed much sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gurgled a wordless appeal for help, and then perceived that she was
      lashed into her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could take that awful thing out of your mouth, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a look which assured her that he shared in her desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father has tied me into this chair. I tried to make him stop his
      dreadful talk when the boats came and burned the lights. He put me down
      here and made a prisoner of me. It is terrible, all that has been
      happening. I can't understand! I hope you will not think too hard of my
      father, sir. Honestly, he seems to be out of his right mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to return some comforting reply to this wistful appeal, but he
      could only roll his head against the stanchion and make inarticulate
      sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seemed to be very bitter when he brought you below. I could not make
      him listen to reason. I have been thinking&mdash;and perhaps you're the
      gentleman who led the singing which made him so angry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo shook his head violently in protest at this suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mind,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;I knew it was only in fun.&rdquo; She
      pondered for a few minutes. &ldquo;Perhaps they wouldn't have teased one of
      their city girl friends in that way&mdash;but I suppose men must have a
      good time when they are away from home. Only&mdash;it has made it hard for
      me!&rdquo; There were tears in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo's face grew purple as he tried to speak past the restraining spike
      and make her understand his sentiments on the subject of that serenade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't try to talk, sir. I'm so sorry. It is shameful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence in the cabin after that for a long time. He looked up at
      the swinging lamp, his gaze wandered about the homely cabin. But his eyes
      kept returning to her face. He could not use his tongue, and he tried to
      tell her by his glances, apologetic little starings, that he was sorry for
      her in her grief. She met those glances with manifest embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an absence which was prolonged to suit his own sour will in the
      matter, Captain Candage came stamping stormily down the companionway. He
      stood between his captives and glowered, first at one and then at the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both of ye blaming me, I reckon, for what couldn't be helped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, listen to me now, if you have any sense left in you,&rdquo; cried the
      girl, with passion. &ldquo;Take that horrible thing out of that gentleman's
      mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has come to a pretty pass in this world when an honest man can't carry
      on his own private business without having to tie up meddlers so as to
      have a little peace.&rdquo; He walked close to Mayo and shook a monitory finger
      under the young man's nose. &ldquo;Now, what did ye come on board here for,
      messing into my affairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The indignant captain put forth his best efforts to make suitable retort,
      but could only emit a series of &ldquo;guggles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now on top of it all I am told by my mate, who never gets around to
      do anything that ought to be done till it's two days too late, that you
      are one of the Mayos! Why wasn't I informed? I might have made
      arrangements to show you some favors. I might have hove to and taken a
      chance, considering who you was. And now it's too late. Everybody seems to
      be ready to impose on me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Mayo tried to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you shut up that gobbling and talk sense?&rdquo; shouted the irate
      skipper, with maddening disregard of the captive's predicament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, are you completely crazy? You haven't taken that spike out of his
      mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Expect a man to remember everything when he is all wrapped in his own
      business and everybody trying to meddle with it?&rdquo; grumbled Candage. He
      fumbled in his pocket and produced a knife. He slashed away the rope yarn
      which lashed the marlinespike. &ldquo;If you can talk sense I'll help you do it!
      I reckon you can holler all you want to now. Them dudes can't find their
      own mouths in a fog, much less this schooner. Now talk up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo worked his aching jaws and found his voice. &ldquo;You know how I happened
      to get aboard, Captain Candage. I am skipper of the <i>Olenia</i>. Put
      back with me if you want to save trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by a tin hoopus, sir! I ain't going about and tackle them reefs in
      this fog. I've got open sea ahead, and I shall keep going!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo was a sailor who knew that coast, and he admitted to himself that
      Candage's stubbornness was justified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't responsible for your getting aboard here. I'll land you as soon
      as I can&mdash;and that covers the law, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During a prolonged silence the two men stared at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, Captain Candage, I trust you will not consider that you have
      a right to keep me tied up here any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that there's a better understanding about who is boss aboard here, I
      don't know as I'm afraid to have you at large,&rdquo; admitted the skipper. &ldquo;I
      only warn you to remember your manners and don't forget that I'm captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flourished his clasp-knife and bent and cut the lashings. Then he
      strode across the cabin and performed like service for his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I can afford to have <i>you</i> loose, too, now that you can't
      tell me my business in front of a lot of skylarkers throwing kisses right
      and left!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father! Oh, oh!&rdquo; She put her hands to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage seemed to be having some trouble in keeping up his rôle of
      a bucko shipmaster; he shifted his eyes from Mayo's scowl and surveyed his
      daughter with uncertainty while he scratched his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a man ain't boss on his own schooner he might as well stop going to
      sea,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Some folks knows it's the truth, being in a position
      to know, and others has to be showed!&rdquo; He went stamping up the
      companionway into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo waited, for some minutes. The girl did not lift her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About that&mdash;What he said about&mdash;You understand! I know better!&rdquo;
       he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; she said, gratefully, still hiding her face from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men sometimes do very foolish things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know my father could be like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking about the men who came and annoyed him. I can understand
      how he felt, because I am 'a 'native' myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were from outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Boyd Mayo. I'm from Mayoport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him with frank interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My folks built this schooner,&rdquo; he stated, with modest pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm Polly Candage&mdash;I'm named for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too bad!&rdquo; he blurted. &ldquo;I don't mean to say but what the name is all
      right,&rdquo; he explained, awkwardly, &ldquo;but I don't think that either of us is
      particularly proud of this old hooker right at the present moment.&rdquo; He
      went across the cabin and sat down on a transom and, tested the bump on
      the back of his head with cautious palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply, and he set his elbows on his knees and proceeded to
      nurse his private grouch in silence, quite excluding his companion from
      his thoughts. Now that he had been snatched so summarily from his hateful
      position on board the <i>Olenia</i>, his desire to leave her was not so
      keen. After Mayo's declaration to the owner, Marston might readily
      conclude that his skipper had deserted. His reputation and his license as
      a shipmaster were in jeopardy, and he had already had a bitter taste of
      Marston's intolerance of shortcomings. If Marston cared to bother about
      breaking such a humble citizen, malice had a handy weapon. But most of all
      was Mayo concerned with the view Alma Marston would take of the situation.
      She would either believe that he had fallen overboard in the skirmish with
      the attacking Polly or had deserted without warning&mdash;and in the case
      of a lover both suppositions were agonizing. His distress was so apparent
      that the girl, from her seat on the opposite transom, extended sympathy in
      the glances she dared to give him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you tear your coat so badly in the back?&rdquo; she ventured at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spikes your excellent father left sticking out of his martingale,&rdquo; he
      said, a sort of boyish resentment in his tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is only right that I should offer to mend it for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hurried to a locker, as if glad of an excuse to occupy herself. She
      produced her little sewing-basket and then came to him and held out her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it off, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't trouble,&rdquo; he expostulated, still gruff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insist. Please let me do a little something to make up for the <i>Polly's</i>
      naughtiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be all right until I can get ashore&mdash;and perhaps I'll never
      have need to wear the coat again, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you allow me to be doing something that will take my mind off my
      troubles, sir?&rdquo; Then she snapped her finger into her palm and there was a
      spirit of matronly command in her voice, in spite of her youth. &ldquo;I insist,
      I say! Take off your coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed, a little grin crinkling at the corners of his mouth&mdash;a
      flicker of light in his general gloom. After he had placed the coat in her
      hands he sat down on the transom and watched her busy fingers. She worked
      deftly. She closed in the rents and then darned the raveled places with
      bits of the thread pulled from the coat itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are making it look almost as good as new.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A country girl must know how to patch and darn. The folks in the country
      haven't as many things to throw away as the city folks have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&mdash;what you are doing&mdash;that's real art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My aunt does dressmaking and I have helped her. And lately I have been
      working in a millinery-shop. Any girl ought to know how to use her
      needle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He remembered what Mr. Speed had said about the reason for her presence on
      the <i>Polly</i>. He cast a disparaging glance around the bare cabin and
      decided in his mind that Mr. Speed had reported truthfully and with full
      knowledge of the facts. Surely no girl would choose that sort of thing for
      a summer vacation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent her head lower over her work and he was conscious of warmer
      sympathy for her; their troubled affairs of the heart were in similar
      plight. He felt an impulse to say something to console her and knew that
      he would welcome understanding and consolation from her; promptly he was
      afraid of his own tongue, and set curb upon all speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man never knows how far he may go in making fool talk when he gets
      started,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;Feeling the way I do to-night, I'd better keep
      the conversation kedge well hooked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now that her hands were busy, she did not find the silence embarrassing.
      Mayo returned to his ugly meditations.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time he was obliged to shift himself on the transom. The schooner
      was heeling in a manner which showed the thrust of wind. He glanced up and
      saw that the rain was smearing broad splashes on the dingy glass of the
      windows. The companion hatch was open, and when he cocked his ear, with
      mariner's interest in weather, he heard the wind gasping in the open space
      with a queer &ldquo;guffle&rdquo; in its tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively he began to look about the cabin for a barometer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already that day the <i>Olenia's</i> glass had warned him by its downward
      tendency. He wondered whether further reading would indicate something
      more ominous than fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the cabin he noted some sort of an instrument swinging from a hook
      on a carline. He investigated. It was a makeshift barometer, the
      advertising gift of a yeast company. The contents of its tube were roiled
      to the height of the mark which was lettered &ldquo;Tornado.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't tell nothing from that!&rdquo; Captain Candage had come down into the
      cabin and stood behind his involuntary guest. &ldquo;It has registered 'Tornado'
      ever since the glass got cracked. And even at that, it's about as reliable
      as any of the rest of them tinkerdiddle things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you a regular barometer&mdash;an aneroid?&rdquo; inquired Captain Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can smell all the weather I need to without bothering with one of them
      contrivances,&rdquo; declared the master of the schooner, in lordly manner. He
      began to pull dirty oilskins out of a locker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo hurried up the companionway and put out his head. There were both
      weight and menace in the wind which hooted past his ears. The fog was
      gone, but the night was black, without glimmer of stars. The white crests
      of the waves which galloped alongside flaked the darkness with ominous
      signalings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can smell weather, Captain Candage, your nose ought to tell you
      that this promises to be something pretty nasty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it might be called nasty by lubbers on a gingerbread yacht, but I
      have sailed the seas in my day and season, and I don't run for an inshore
      puddle every time the wind whickers a little.&rdquo; He was fumbling with a
      button under his crisp roll of chin beard and gave the other man a stare
      of superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't class me with yacht-lubbers, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you was just on a yacht, wasn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Captain Candage, you may just as well understand, now and
      here, that I'm one of your kind of sailors. Excuse me for personal talk,
      but I want to inform you that from fifteen to twenty I was a
      Grand-Banksman. Last season I was captain of the beam trawler <i>Laura and
      Marion</i>. And I have steamboated in the Sound and have been a first mate
      in the hard-pine trade in Southern waters. I have had a chance to find out
      more or less about weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Un-huh!&rdquo; remarked the skipper, feigning indifference. &ldquo;What about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that you have no business running out into this mess that is
      making from east'ard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have been so much and so mighty in your time, then you understand
      that a captain takes orders from nobody when he's on board his own
      vessel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand perfectly well, sir. I'm not giving orders. But my own life
      is worth something to me and I have a right to tell you that you are
      taking foolhardy chances. And you know it, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage's gaze shifted. He was a coaster and he was naturally
      cautious, as Apple-treers are obliged to be. He knew perfectly well that
      he was in the presence of a man who knew! He had not the assurance to
      dispute that man, though his general grudge against all the world at that
      moment prompted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got out because they drove me out,&rdquo; he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man can't afford to be childish when he is in command of a vessel, sir.
      You are too old a skipper to deny that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was so mad I didn't stop to smell weather,&rdquo; admitted the master,
      bracing himself to meet a fresh list of the heeling <i>Polly</i>. He
      evidently felt that he ought to defend his own sagacity and absolve
      himself from mariner's culpability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! Let it go at that! But what are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't beat back to Saturday Cove against this wind&mdash;not now! She
      would rack her blamed old butts out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then run her for Lumbo Reach. You can quarter a following sea. She ought
      to ride fairly easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a narrow stab in a night as black as this one is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll make a cross-bearing for you. Where's your chart?&rdquo; Mayo exhibited a
      sailor's alert anxiety to be helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'ain't ever needed a chart&mdash;not for this coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll have to guess at it, sir.&rdquo; He closed his eyes in order to
      concentrate. &ldquo;You gave a course of sou'west by sou'. Let's see&mdash;it
      was nine-fifteen when I just looked and we must have logged&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't no use to stab for such a hole in the wall as Lumbo Reach,&rdquo;
       declared Candage in discouraged tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you've got your compass and I can&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain't no depending on my compass within two points and a half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it, I can make allowance, sir, if you'll tell me your
      deviation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's a card compass and spins so bad in a seaway there ain't no
      telling, anyway. In my coasting I haven't had to be particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as long as you had an apple-tree in sight,&rdquo; jeered Mayo, beginning to
      lose his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't dare to run in the direction of anything that is solid&mdash;we'll
      hit it sure, 'n' hell-fire will toast corn bread. We've got to stay to
      sea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo set his teeth and clenched his fists and took a few turns up
      and down the cabin. He looked up into the night through the open hatch of
      the companion-way. The pale glimmer of the swinging lamp tossed a mild
      flare against the blackness and lighted two faces which were limned
      against that pall. Both Oakum Otie and Smut-nosed Dolph were at the wheel.
      Their united strength was needed because the schooner was yawing madly
      every now and then when the mightier surges of the frothing sea hoisted
      her counter, chasing behind her like wild horses. Those faces, when Mayo
      looked on them, were very solemn. The two were crouching like men who were
      anxious to hide from a savage beast. They grunted as they struggled with
      the wheel, trying to hold her up when the <i>Polly</i> tobogganed with
      rushes that were almost breath-checking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo hastened to the girl. &ldquo;I must have my coat, Miss Candage. I thank
      you. It will do now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held it open for his arms, as a maid might aid her knight with his
      armor. &ldquo;Are we in danger?&rdquo; she asked, tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not&mdash;only it is uncomfortable&mdash;and needless,&rdquo; he said,
      with some irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I stay down here&mdash;alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would! It's only a summer blow, Miss Candage. I'm sure we'll be all
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage had gone on deck, rattling away in his stiff oilskins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo followed, but the master came down a few steps into the companionway
      and intercepted the volunteer, showing a final smolder of his surliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to notify you that I can run my own bo't, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, run it with a yeast barometer, a straw bottom, a pinwheel compass,
      and your general cussedness of disposition,&rdquo; shouted Mayo into the whirl
      of the wind, his anxiety whetting his much-tried temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're feeling that way, I don't want you up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm feeling worse than you'll ever understand, you stubborn old fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I let one man call me a fool to-day and I didn't make back talk&mdash;but
      I know where to draw the line,&rdquo; warned Candage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, I propose to start in with you right now, sir, on a basis
      you'll understand! I say you're a fool and need a guardian&mdash;and from
      now on I'm going to make my bigness aboard here! Get out of my way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo then emphasized his opinion of Captain Candage by elbowing
      the master to one side and leaping out on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be mutiny,&rdquo; stated Mr. Speed through set teeth, checking the
      startled exclamation from his helper at the wheel. &ldquo;But, by the Judas
      I-scarrot, it's a Mayo that's doing it! Remember that, Dolph!&rdquo;
     </p>

      VIII ~ LIKE BUGS UNDER A THIMBLE

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Up comes the skipper from down below,
     And he looks aloft and he looks alow.
     And he looks alow and he looks aloft,
     And it's, &ldquo;Coil up your ropes, there, fore and aft.&rdquo;
           With a big Bow-wow!
              Tow-row-row!
          Fal de rai de, ri do day!
                  &mdash;Boston Shanty.
</pre>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo strode straight to the men at the wheel. &ldquo;Give me those
      spokes!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;I'll take her! Get in your washing, boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, sir!&rdquo; assented Mr. Speed, giving the resisting Dolph a violent
      shove.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Captain Candage began to curse, Captain Mayo showed that he had a
      voice and vocabulary of his own. He fairly roared down the master of the
      <i>Polly</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now shut up!&rdquo; he ordered the dumfounded skipper, who faced him, mouth
      agape. &ldquo;This is no time for any more foolishness. It's a case of work
      together to save our lives. Down with 'em, boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; declared the mate. &ldquo;She don't need much of anything on her
      except a double-reefed mitten with the thumb brailed up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wind had not attained the velocity of a gale, but it did have an ugly
      growl which suggested further violence. Mayo braced himself, ready to
      bring the schooner about in order to give the crew an opportunity to
      shorten sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage, deposed as autocrat for the moment, seemed to be
      uncertain as to his duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo, understanding mariner nature, felt some contrition and was prompted
      by saner second thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better take the wheel, Captain Candage. You know her tricks better
      than I do in a seaway. I'll help the boys take in sail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The master obeyed with alacrity. He seemed to be cowed. Anger no longer
      blinded him to their predicament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just say what you want done, and I'll try to do it,&rdquo; he told Mayo, in a
      voice which had become suddenly mild and rather beseeching. Then he called
      to his daughter, who had come to the foot of the companion steps, &ldquo;Better
      blow out that cabin light, Polly girl! She's li'ble to dance bad, and we
      don't want to run the chance of fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo got a glimpse at her face as he hurried upon the house on his way to
      the main halyards. Her face was pale, but there was the firm spirit of her
      Yankee ancestry of the sea in her poise and in her very silence in that
      crisis. She obeyed without complaint or question and the cabin was dark;
      even the glimmer of the light had held something of cheer. Now the gloom
      was somber and depressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The schooner came round with a sort of scared hurry when the master threw
      the wheel hard over and trod on the spokes with all his weight. As soon as
      the bellying mainsail began to flap, the three men let it go on the run.
      They kept up the jumbo sail, as the main jib is called; they reefed the
      foresail down to its smallest compass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo, young, nimble, and eager, singly knotted more reef points than both
      his helpers together, and his crisp commands were obeyed unquestioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sartinly is chain lightning in pants,&rdquo; confided Dolph to Otie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows his card,&rdquo; said Otie to Dolph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo led the way aft, crawling over the shingles and laths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it's your judgment, sir, that we'd better keep her into the wind
      as she is and try to ride this thing out,&rdquo; he suggested to the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my judgment, sir,&rdquo; returned Captain Candage, with official gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hove to, the old <i>Polly</i> rode in fairly comfortable style. She was
      deep with her load of lumber, but the lumber made her buoyant and she
      lifted easily. Her breadth of beam helped to steady her in the sweeping
      seas&mdash;but Captain Mayo clung to a mainstay and faced the wind and the
      driving rain and knew that the open Atlantic was no place for the <i>Polly</i>
      on a night like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spume from the crested breakers at her wallowing bow salted the rain on
      his dripping face. It was an unseasonable tempest, scarcely to be looked
      for at that time of year. But he had had frequent experience with the
      vagaries of easterlies, and he knew that a summer easterly, when it comes,
      holds menacing possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They knowed how to build schooners when your old sirs built this one at
      Mayoport,&rdquo; declared Captain Candage, trying to put a conciliatory tone
      into his voice when he bellowed against the blast. &ldquo;She'll live where one
      of these fancy yachts of twice her size would be smothered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo did not answer. He leaped upon the house and helped Dolph and Otie
      furl the mainsail that lay sprawled in the lazy-jaeks. They took their
      time; the more imminent danger seemed to be over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knowed a summer blow to amount to much,&rdquo; observed Mr. Speed,
      trying to perk up, though he was hanging on by both hands to avoid bring
      blown off the slippery house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends on whether there's an extra special squall knotted into it
      somewhere to windward,&rdquo; said Mayo, in a lull of the wind. &ldquo;Then it can
      amount to a devil of a lot, Mr. Speed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The schooner washed her nose in a curving billow that came inboard and
      swept aft. With her small area of exposed sail and with the wind buffeting
      her, she had halted and paid off, lacking steerageway. She got several
      wallops of the same sort before she had gathered herself enough to head
      into the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she paid off, as if trying to avoid a volleying gust, and another
      wave crested itself ahead of the blunt bows and then seemed to explode,
      dropping tons of water on deck. Laths, lumber, and bunches of shingles
      were ripped loose and went into the sea. The <i>Polly</i> appeared to be
      showing sagacity of her own in that crisis; she was jettisoning cargo for
      her own salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Cephas! this is going to lose us our decklo'd,&rdquo; wailed the master.
      &ldquo;We'd better let her run!&rdquo; &ldquo;Don't you do it, sir! You'll never get her
      about!&rdquo; Mayo had given over his work on the sail and was listening. Above
      the scream of the passing gusts which assailed him he was hearing a dull
      and solemn roar to windward. He suspected what that sound indicated. He
      had heard it before in his experience. He tried to peer into the driving
      storm, dragging the rain from his eyes with his fingers. Then nature held
      a torch for him. A vivid shaft of lightning crinkled overhead and spread a
      broad flare of illumination across the sea. His suspicions, which had been
      stirred by that sullen roar, were now verified. He saw a low wall of white
      water, rolling and frothing. It was a summer &ldquo;spitter&rdquo; trampling the
      waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      A spitter is a freak in a regular tempest&mdash;a midsummer madness of
      weather upheaval. It is a thunderbolt of wind, a concentration of gale, a
      whirling dervish of disaster&mdash;wind compactly bunched into one
      almighty blast&mdash;wind enough to last a regular gale for a whole day if
      the stock were spent thriftily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ease her an inch!&rdquo; screamed Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just then another surging sea climbed aboard and picked up more of the
      laths and more of the shingles, and frolicked away into the night with the
      plunder. Captain Candage's sense of thrift got a more vital jab than did
      his sense of fear. His eyes were on his wheel, and he had not seen the
      wall of white spume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That decklo'd has got to be lashed,&rdquo; he muttered. He decided to run with
      the wind till that work could be performed. He threw his helm hard over.
      Mayo had been riding the main boom astraddle, hitching himself toward the
      captain, to make him hear. When the volunteer saw the master of the <i>Polly</i>
      trying to turn tail to the foe in that fashion, he leaped to the wheel,
      but he was too late. The schooner had paid off too much. The yelling
      spitter caught them as they were poised broadside on the top of a wave,
      before the sluggish craft had made her full turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happened then might have served as confirmation of mariners'
      superstition that a veritable demon reigns in the heart of the tempest.
      The attack on the old <i>Polly</i> showed devilish intelligence in
      team-work. A crashing curler took advantage of the loosened deckload and
      smashed the schooner a longside buffet which sent all the lumber in a
      sliding drive against the lee rail and rigging. The mainsail had been only
      partly secured; the spitter blew into the flapping canvas with all its
      force and the sail snapped free and bellied out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next instant the <i>Polly</i> was tripped!
    </p>
    <p>
      She went over with all the helpless, dead-weight violence of a man who has
      caught his toe on a drooping clothes line in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four men who were on deck were sailors and they did not need orders
      when they felt that soul-sickening swing of her as she toppled.
      Instinctively, with one accord, they dived for the cabin companionway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly, as a sailor, the first thought of each was that the schooner
      was going on to her beam-ends. Therefore, to remain on deck meant that
      they would either slide into the water or that a smashing wave would carry
      them off.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went tumbling down together in the darkness, and all four of them,
      with impulse of preservation as instant and true as that of the trap-door
      spider, set their hands to the closing of the hatch and the folding leaves
      of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo, his clutch still on a knob, found himself pulled under water
      without understanding at first just what had happened. He let go his grip
      and came up to the surface, spouting. He heard the girl shriek in
      extremity of terror, so near him that her breath swept his face. He put
      out his arm and caught her while he was floundering for a footing. When he
      found something on which to stand and had steadied himself, he could not
      comprehend just what had happened; the floor he was standing on had queer
      irregularities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've gone over!&rdquo; squalled Mr. Speed in the black darkness. &ldquo;We've gone
      clear over. We're upside down. We're standing on the ceiling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mayo trod about a bit and convinced himself that the irregularities
      under his feet were the beams and carlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Polly</i> had been tripped in good earnest! Mr. Speed was right&mdash;she
      was squarely upside down!
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in that moment of stress Mayo could figure out how it had happened.
      The spitter must have ripped all her rotten canvas off her spars as she
      rolled and there had been no brace to hold her on her beam-ends when she
      went over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage was spouting, splashing near at hand, and was bellowing
      his fears. Then he began to call for his daughter in piteous fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you drownded, Polly darling?&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have her safe, sir,&rdquo; Mayo assured him in husky tones, trying to clear
      the water from his throat. &ldquo;Stand on a beam. You can get half of your body
      above water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all off with us,&rdquo; gasped the master. &ldquo;We're spoke for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such utter and impenetrable blackness Mayo had never experienced before.
      Their voices boomed dully, as if they were in a huge hogshead which had
      been headed over.
    </p>
    <p>
      '&ldquo;Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep,'&rdquo; quavered
      the cook. &ldquo;If anybody knows a better prayer I wish he'd say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plumb over&mdash;upside down! Worse off than flies in a puddle of Porty
      Reek molasses,&rdquo; mourned Mr. Speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master joined the mate in lamentation. &ldquo;I have brought my baby to
      this! I have brought my Polly here! God forgive me. Can't you speak to me,
      Polly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo found the girl very quiet in the hook of his arm, and he put his free
      hand against her cheek. She did not move under his touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has fainted, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she's dead! She's dead!&rdquo; Candage began to weep and started to splash
      his way across the cabin, directed by Mayo's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is all right&mdash;she is breathing,&rdquo; the young man assured the
      father. &ldquo;Here! This way, captain! Take her. Hold her up. I want to see
      whether anything can be done for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing can be done!&rdquo; whimpered Candage. &ldquo;We're goners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're goners,&rdquo; averred Oakum Otie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're goners,&rdquo; echoed Dolph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo gave the girl into the groping arms of her father and stood for a few
      moments reflecting on their desperate plight. He was not hopeful. In his
      heart he agreed with the convictions which his mates were expressing in
      childish falsetto. But being a young sailor who found his head above
      water, he resolved to keep on battling in that emergency; the adage of the
      coastwise mariner is: &ldquo;Don't die till Davy Jones sets his final pinch on
      your weasen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      First of all, he gave full consideration to what had happened. The <i>Polly</i>
      had been whipped over so quickly that she had been transformed into a sort
      of diving-bell.{*} That is to say, a considerable amount of air had been
      captured and was now retained in her. It was compressed by the water which
      was forced up from below through the windows and the shattered skylight.
      The pressure on Mayo's temples afforded him information on this point. The
      <i>Polly</i> was floating, and he felt comforting confidence that she
      would continue to float for some time. But this prospect did not insure
      safety or promise life to the unfortunates who had been trapped in her
      bowels. The air must either escape gradually or become vitiated as they
      breathed it.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The strange adventure of the <i>Polly</i> is not an
     improbability of fiction. A Bath, Maine, schooner, lumber-
     laden, was tripped in exactly this fashion off Hatteras.
     Captain Boyd Mayo's exploit has been paralleled in real life
     in all details. My good friend Captain Elliott C. Gardner,
     former skipper of the world's only seven-master, the <i>Thomas
     W. Lawson</i>, furnished those details to me, and after writing
     this part of the tale I submitted the narrative to him for
     confirmation.   It has received his indorsement.&mdash;H. D.
</pre>
    <p>
      There was only one thing to do, he decided: take advantage of any period
      of truce which their ancient enemy, the sea, had allowed in that desperate
      battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sailor is prey to hazards and victim of the unexpected in the
      ever-changing moods of the ocean; he must needs be master of expedients
      and ready grappler of emergencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are your tools&mdash;a saw&mdash;a chisel?&rdquo; demanded Mayo. He was
      obliged to repeat that query several times. His companions appeared to be
      wholly absorbed in their personal woes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Mr. Speed checked his groans long enough to state that the tools
      were in &ldquo;the lazareet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lazaret of a coaster is a storeroom under the quarter-deck&mdash;repository
      of general odds and ends and spare equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any way to get at it except through the deck-hatch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a door through, back of the companion ladder,&rdquo; said Mr. Speed,
      with listless indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo crowded his way past the ladder after he had waded and stumbled here
      and there and had located it. He set his shoulders against the slope of
      the steps and pushed at the door with his feet. After he had forced it
      open he waded into the storeroom. It was blind business, hunting for
      anything in that place. He knew the general habits of the hit-or-miss
      coasting crews, and was sure that the tools had been thrown in among the
      rest of the clutter by the person who used them last. If they had been
      loose on the floor they would now be loose on the ceiling. He pushed his
      feet about, hoping to tread on something that felt like a saw or chisel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahoy, you men out there!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Don't you have any idea in what
      part of this lazaret the tools were?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they was probably just throwed in,&rdquo; said Mr. Speed. &ldquo;I wish you
      wouldn't bother me so much! I'm trying to compose my mind to pray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were so much ruck and stuff under his feet that Mayo gave up
      searching after a time. He had held his breath and ducked his head under
      water so that he might investigate with his bare hands, but he found
      nothing which would help him, and his brain was dizzy after his efforts
      and his mouth was choked by the dirty water.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he groped his way back into the main cabin his hands came in
      contact with the inside of the lazaret door. In leather loops on the door
      he found saw, ax, chisel, and hammer. He was unable to keep back a few
      hearty and soul-satisfying oaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you tell me where the tools were? They're here on the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had forgot about picking 'em tip. And my mind ain't on tools, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mind will be on 'em as soon as I can get forward there,&rdquo; growled the
      incensed captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo was not sure of what he needed or what he would be obliged to do,
      therefore he took all the tools, holding them above water. When he waded
      past Captain Can-dage he heard the old skipper trying to comfort the girl,
      his voice low and broken by sobs. She had recovered consciousness and Mayo
      was a bit sorry; in her swoon she had not realized their plight; he feared
      hysterics and other feminine demonstrations, and he knew that he needed
      all his nerve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're going to die&mdash;we're going to die!&rdquo; the girl kept moaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my poor baby, and I have brought you to it,&rdquo; blubbered her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please keep up your courage for a little while, Miss Candage,&rdquo; Mayo
      pleaded, wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there's no hope!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's hope just as long as we have a little air and a little grit,&rdquo; he
      insisted. &ldquo;Now, please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;But we're all going to work the best we know
      how. Can't you encourage us like a brave, good girl?&rdquo; He went stumbling
      on. &ldquo;Now tell me, mate,&rdquo; he commanded, briskly, &ldquo;how thick is the bulkhead
      between the cabin, here, and the hold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't bother to think,&rdquo; returned Mr. Speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only sheathing between the beams, sir,&rdquo; stated Captain Candage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mate, you and the cook lend a hand to help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oakum Otie broke off the prayer to which he had returned promptly. &ldquo;What's
      the use?&rdquo; he demanded, with anger which his fright made juvenile. &ldquo;I tell
      you I'm trying to compose my soul, and I want this rampage-round stopped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say what's the use, too!&rdquo; whined Dolph. &ldquo;You can't row a biskit across
      a puddle of molasses with a couple of toothpicks,&rdquo; he added, with cook's
      metaphor for the absolutely hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo shouted at them with a violence that made hideous din in that narrow
      space. &ldquo;You two men wade across here to me or I'll come after you with an
      ax in one hand and a hammer in the other! Damn you, I mean business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were silent, then there sounded the splash of water and they came,
      muttering. They had recognized the ring of desperate resolve in his
      command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo, when he heard their stertorous breathing close at hand, groped for
      them and shoved tools into their clutch. He retained the hammer and chisel
      for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's about all I need you for just now&mdash;for tool-racks,&rdquo; he
      growled. &ldquo;Make sure you don't drop those.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The upturned schooner rolled sluggishly, and every now and then the water
      swashed across her cabin with extra impetus, making footing insecure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I tumble down I'll have to drop 'em,&rdquo; whimpered Oolph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don't come up. Drowning will be an easier death for you,&rdquo; declared
      the captain, menacingly. He was sounding the bulkhead with his hammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tapping quickly showed him where the upright beams were located on the
      other side of the sheathing. In his own mind he was not as sanguine as his
      activity might have indicated. It was blind experiment&mdash;he could not
      estimate the obstacles which were ahead of him. But he did understand,
      well enough, that if they were to escape they must do so through the
      bottom of the vessel amidship; there, wallowing though she was, there
      might be some freeboard. He had seen vessels floating bottom up. Usually a
      section of the keel and a portion of the garboard streaks were in sight
      above the sea. But there could be no escape through the bottom of the
      craft above them where they stood in the cabin. He knew that the counter
      and buttock must be well under water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a full cargo belowdecks?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; stated Captain Candage, hinting by his tone that he wondered what
      difference that would make to them in the straits in which they were
      placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo felt a bit of fresh courage. He had been afraid that the <i>Polly's</i>
      hold would be found to be stuffed full of lumber. His rising spirits
      prompted a little sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did it ever happen that you didn't plug the trap you set for us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't get but two-thirds cargo below because the lumber was sawed so
      long. Made it up by extra deck-lo'd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, piled it all on deck so as to make her top-heavy&mdash;so as to be
      sure of catching us,&rdquo; suggested Mayo, beginning to work his hammer and
      chisel on the sheathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tain't no such thing!&rdquo; expostulated Captain Candage, missing the irony.
      &ldquo;Them shingles and laths is packet freight, and I couldn't put 'em below
      because I've got to deliver 'em this side of New York. And you don't
      expect me to overhaul a whole decklo'd so as to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; broke in Mayo. &ldquo;The Atlantic Ocean has attended to the case of
      that deckload.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Gawd, yes!&rdquo; mourned the master. &ldquo;I was forgetting that we are upside
      down&mdash;and that shows what a state of mind I'm in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo had picked his spot for operations. He drove his chisel through the
      sheathing as close to the cabin floor as he could. Remembering that the
      schooner was upside down and that the floor was over his head, the
      aperture he was starting work on would bring him nearest the bilge. When
      he had chiseled a hole big enough for a start, he secured the saw from the
      mate and sawed a square opening. He lifted himself up and worked his way
      through the hole and found himself on lumber and out of water. It was what
      he had been hoping to find, after the assurance from the master: the
      partial cargo of lumber in the hold had settled to the deck when the
      schooner tipped over. Investigating with groping hands, he assured himself
      that there were fully three feet of space between the cargo and the bottom
      of the vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here with your daughter, Captain Candage!&rdquo; he called, cheerily.
      &ldquo;It's dry in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kneeled and held his hands out through the opening, directing them with
      his voice, reaching into the pitchy darkness until her hands found his,
      and then he brought her up to him and in upon the lumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a little better, even if it's nothing to brag about,&rdquo; he told her.
      &ldquo;Sit over there at one side so that the men can crawl in past you. I'll
      need them to help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you think now&mdash;shall we die?&rdquo; she asked, in tremulous
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't think so,&rdquo; he told her, stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were alone in the hold for a few moments while the others were
      helping one another through the opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in this trap&mdash;in the dark&mdash;crowded in here!&rdquo; Her tone did
      not express doubt; it was pathetic endeavor to understand their plight.
      &ldquo;My father and his men are frightened&mdash;they have given up. And you
      told me that you are frightened!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are not doing anything to help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that is because they are not scared as much as I am. It often
      happens that the more frightened a man is in a tight place the more he
      jumps around and the harder he tries to get out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care what you say&mdash;I know what you are!&rdquo; she rejoined. &ldquo;You
      are a brave man, Captain Mayo. I thank you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet! Not until&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, now! You have set me a good example. When folks are scared they
      should not sit down and whimper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reached and found a plump little fist which she had doubled into a real
      knob of decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good work, little girl! Your kind of grit is helping me.&rdquo; He released her
      hand and crawled forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This ain't helping us any,&rdquo; complained Captain Candage. &ldquo;I know what's
      going to happen to us. As soon as it gets daylight a cussed coast-guard
      cutter will come snorting along and blow us up without bothering to find
      out what is under this turkle-shell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, look here, Candage,&rdquo; called Captain Mayo, angrily, &ldquo;that's enough of
      that talk! There's a-plenty happening to us as it is, without your
      infernal driveling about what <i>may</i> happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it about time for a real man to help Captain Mayo instead of
      hindering him?&rdquo; asked the girl. Evidently her new composure startled her
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't you scared any more, Polly? You ain't losing your mind, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have it back again, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your daughter is setting you a good example, Captain Candage. Now let's
      get down to business, sir! What's your sheathing on the ribs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inch and a half spruce, if I remember right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take it she is ribbed about every twelve inches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Near's I remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! Swarm forward here, the three of you, and have those tools
      handy as I need 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had brought the hammer and chisel in his reefer pockets, and set at
      work on the sheathing over his head, having picked by touch and sense of
      locality a section which he considered to be nearly amidship. It was blind
      effort, but he managed to knock away a few square feet of the spruce
      boarding after a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hand me that saw, whoever has it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hand came fumbling to his in the dark and gave him the tool. He began on
      one of the oak ribs, uncovered when the boarding had been removed. It was
      difficult and tedious work, for he could use only the tip of the saw,
      because the ribs were so close together. But he toiled on steadily, and at
      last the sound of his diligence appeared to animate the others. When he
      rested for a moment Captain Candage offered to help with the sawing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I'll be obliged to do it alone, sir. You can't tell in the dark
      where I have left off. However, I'm glad to see that you're coming back to
      your senses,&rdquo; he added, a bit caustically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master of the <i>Polly</i> received that rebuke with a meekness that
      indicated a decided change of heart. &ldquo;I reckon me and Otie and Dolph have
      been acting out what you might call pretty pussylaminous, as I heard a
      schoolmarm say once,&rdquo; confessed the skipper, struggling with the big word.
      &ldquo;But we three ain't as young as we was once, and I'll leave it to you,
      sir, if this wasn't something that nobody had ever reckoned on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's considerable novelty in it,&rdquo; said Mayo, in dry tones, running his
      fingers over the rib to find the saw-scarf. The ache had gone out of his
      arms, and he was ready to begin again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry we yanked you into all this trouble,&rdquo; Can-dage went on. &ldquo;And on
      the other hand, I ain't so sorry! Because if you hadn't been along with us
      we'd never have got out of this scrape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven't got out of it yet, Captain Candage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we are making an almighty good start, and I want to say here in the
      hearing of all interested friends that you're the smartest cuss I ever saw
      afloat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will forgive father,&rdquo; pleaded Polly of the <i>Polly</i>. He
      felt her breath on his cheek. She was so near that her voice nearly jumped
      him. &ldquo;I don't mean to get in your way, Captain Mayo, but somehow I feel
      safer if I'm close to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I guess all of us do,&rdquo; admitted Captain Candage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo stopped sawing for a moment. &ldquo;What say, men? Let's be Yankee sailors
      from this time on! We'll be the right sort, eh? We'll put this brave
      little girl where she belongs&mdash;on God's solid ground!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; boomed Mr. Speed. &ldquo;I have woke up. I must have been out of my
      mind. I showed you my nature when I first met you, Captain Mayo, and I
      reckon you found it was helpful and enterprising. I'll be the same from
      now on, even if you order me to play goat and try to butt the bottom out
      of her with my head.&rdquo; &ldquo;Me, too!&rdquo; said Smut-nosed Dolph.

      IX ~ A MAN'S JOB
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     O Nancy Dawson, hi&mdash;o!
          Cheer'ly man! She's got a notion, hi&mdash;o!
          Cheer'ly manl For our old bo'sun, hi&mdash;o!
          Cheer'ly man! O hauley hi&mdash;o!
                 Cheer'ly man!
                           &mdash;Hauling Song.
</pre>
    <p>
      Boyd Mayo soon found that his ancestors had put no scrub timber into the
      <i>Polly</i>. The old oak rib was tough as well as bulky. The task of
      sawing with merely the tip of the blade in play required both muscle and
      patience, and the position he was obliged to assume added to his
      difficulties. He rested after he had sawed the rib in four places, and
      decided to give Oakum Otie something to do; the mate had been begging for
      an opportunity to grab in. He was ordered to knock away as much as he
      could of the sawed section with hammer and chisel. Mayo figured that when
      this section of rib had been removed it would leave room for a hole
      through the bottom planks at least two feet square&mdash;and there were no
      swelling girths in their party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mate had strength, and he was eager to display that helpful spirit of
      which he had boasted. He went at the beam with all his might.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo's attention had been centered on his task; now, with a moment's
      leisure in which to note other matters, he was conscious of something
      which provoked his apprehension; the air under the hull of the schooner
      was becoming vitiated. His temples throbbed and his ears rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't it getting pretty stuffy in here?&rdquo; asked the master, putting words
      to Mayo's thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been feeling like a bug under a thimble for some little time,&rdquo;
       stated Otie, whacking his chisel sturdily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her bottom can't be awash with all this lumber in her. If we can only get
      a little speck of a hole through the outside planking right now, we'd
      better do it,&rdquo; suggested Candage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just what I have been doing,&rdquo; declared Mr. Speed. &ldquo;I'm right after
      the job, gents, when I get started on a thing. Helpful and enterprising,
      that's my motto!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next moment, before Mayo, his thoughts busy with his new danger of
      suffocation, could voice warning or had grasped the full import of the
      dialogue, the chisel's edge plugged through the planking. Instantly there
      was a hiss like escaping steam. Mayo yelled an oath and set his hands
      against the mate, pushing him violently away. The industrious Mr. Speed
      had been devoting his attention to the planking instead of to the sawed
      beam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wan light filtered through the crevice made by the chisel and Mayo planted
      his palm against the crack. The pressure held his hand as if it were
      clamped against the planks, and the hissing ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The schooner, as she lay, upside down in the sea, was practically a
      diving-bell; with that hole in her shell their safety was in jeopardy. The
      girl seemed to understand the situation before the duller minds of her
      father and his mates had begun to work. She frenziedly sought for Mayo's
      disengaged hand and thrust some kind of fabric into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's from my petticoat,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Can you calk with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hand me the chisel,&rdquo; he entreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she had given the tool to him he worked his hand free from the
      crack and instantly drove the fabric into the crevice, crowding it fold by
      fold with the edge of the chisel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope I didn't do anything wrong, trying to be helpful,&rdquo; apologized Mr.
      Speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do the rest of this job without any such help,&rdquo; growled the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are you stopping the air for when it's rushing in to liven us
      up?&rdquo; asked Dolph, plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was rushing out, fool! Rushing out so fast that this lumber would have
      flattened us against the bottom of this hull in a little while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have figgered it just t'other way,&rdquo; stated Mr. Speed, humbly.
      &ldquo;Outside air, being fresh, ought nat'rally to rush in to fill the holes we
      have breathed out of this air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo was in no mood to lecture on natural phenomena. He investigated the
      cut which had been made by the incautious mate and estimated, by what his
      fingers told him, that the schooner's bottom planks were three inches
      thick. He settled back on his haunches and gave a little thought to the
      matter, and understood that he had a ticklish job ahead of him. Those
      planks must be gouged around the complete square of the proposed opening,
      so that the section might be driven out in one piece by a blow from
      beneath. That section must give way wholly and instantly. They were doomed
      if they made a half-job of it. In that pitchy blackness he had only his
      fingers to guide him. That one little streak of light from the open world
      without was tantalizing promise. On the other side of those planks was
      God's limitless air. The poor creatures penned under that hull were
      gasping and choking for want of that air. Mayo set bravely to work,
      hammering at the chisel-head above him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All were silent. They felt the initial languor of suffocation and knew the
      peril which was threatening them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is anything I can do&mdash;&rdquo; ventured Otie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo felt the lack of oxygen most cruelly, because he was working
      with all his might. Perspiration was streaming into his eyes, he was
      panting like a running dog, his blows were losing force.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found that Otie had partly cleared out the rib before that too-willing
      helper had taken it into his head to knock a hole through the planking.
      The rib must come away entirely! The tough oak resisted; the chisel
      slipped; it was maddeningly slow work. But he finished the task at last
      and began to gouge a channel in the planking close to the other ribs.
      Torpor was wrapping its tentacles about him. He heard his companions
      gasping for breath. Then, all at once, he felt a little pat on his
      shoulder. He knew that tap for what it was, though she did not speak to
      him; it was the girl's reassuring touch. It comforted him to be told in
      that manner that she was keeping up her courage in the horrible situation.
      He beveled the planks as deeply as he dared, and made his cut around three
      sides of his square. He was forced to stop for a moment and lay prostrate,
      his face on the lumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take that saw, one of you, and chunk off a few short lengths of plank,&rdquo;
       he whispered, hoarsely. The rasp of the hand-saw informed him that he had
      been obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held his eyes wide open with effort as he lay there in the darkness.
      Then he struggled up and went at his task once more. Queerly colored
      flames were shooting before his straining eyes. He toiled in partial
      delirium, and it seemed to him that he was looking again at the
      phantasmagoria of the Coston lights on the fog when the yachtsmen were
      serenading the girl of the Polly. He found himself muttering, keeping time
      to his chisel-blows:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Our Polly O,
          O'er the sea you go&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In all the human emotions there is no more maddening and soul-flaying
      terror than the fear of being shut in, which wise men call claustrophobia.
      Mayo had been a man of the open&mdash;of wide horizons, drinking from the
      fount of all the air under the heavens. This hideous confinement was
      demoralizing his reason. He wanted to throw down his hammer and chisel and
      scream and kick and throw himself up against the penning planks. On the
      other side was air&mdash;the open! There was still one side of the square
      to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again that comforting little hand touched his shoulder and he was spurred
      by the thought that the girl was still courageous and had faith in him. He
      groaned and kept on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lapse of time ceased to have significance. Every now and then the hammer
      slipped and bruised his hand cruelly. But he did not feel the hurt. Both
      tools wavered in his grasp. He struck a desperate&mdash;a despairing blow
      and the hammer and chisel dropped. He knew that he had finished the fourth
      side. He fell across Polly Candage's lap and she helped him to his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm done, men,&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;All together with those joists! Strike
      together! Right above my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard the skipper count one&mdash;two&mdash;three. He heard the
      concerted blow. The planks did not give way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't seem to have no strength left,&rdquo; explained the mate, in hoarse
      tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      They struck again, but irregularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's our lives&mdash;our lives, men!&rdquo; cried Mayo. &ldquo;Ram it to her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's one for you, Captain Mayo,&rdquo; said Candage, and he thrust a length
      of plank into the groping hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it together, this time&mdash;together!&rdquo; commanded Mayo. &ldquo;Hard&mdash;one,
      two, three!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They drove their battering-rams up against the prisoning roof. Fury and
      despair were behind their blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glory of light flooded into their blinking eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The section had given way!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo went first and he snapped out with almost the violence of a cork
      popping from a bottle. He felt the rush of the imprisoned air past him as
      he emerged. Instantly he turned and thrust down his hands and pulled the
      girl up into the open and the others followed, the lumber pushing under
      their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Captain Mayo, after those few frenzied moments of escape,
      that he had awakened from a nightmare; he found himself clinging to the
      schooner's barnacled keel, his arm holding Polly Candage from sliding down
      over the slimy bottom into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good jeero! We've been in there all night,&rdquo; bawled Captain Candage. He
      lay sprawled on the bottom of the Polly, his hornbeam hands clutching the
      keel, his face upraised wonderingly to the skies that were flooded with
      the glory of the morning. Otie and Dolph were beside him, mouths open,
      gulping in draughts of the air as if they were fish freshly drawn from the
      ocean depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence after the skipper's ejaculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoughts, rather than words, fitted that sacred moment of their salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The five persons who lay there on the bottom of the schooner stared at the
      sun in its cloudless sky and gazed off across the sea whose blue was
      shrouded by the golden haze of a perfect summer's day. Only a lazy roll
      was left of the sudden turbulence of the night before. A listless breeze
      with a fresh tang of salt in it lapped the surface of the long, slow
      surges, and the facets of the ripples flashed back the sunlight cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage pulled himself to the keel, sat upon it, and found speech
      in faltering manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't a member of no church, never having felt the need of j'ining, and
      not being handy where I could tend out. But I ain't ashamed to say here,
      before witnesses, that I have just been telling God, as best I know how,
      hoping He'll excuse me if I 'ain't used the sanctimonious way, that I'm
      going to be a different man after this&mdash;different and better,
      according to my best lights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you have spoken for all of us, Captain Can-dage,&rdquo; said Mayo,
      earnestly. &ldquo;I thank you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all perceived that the <i>Polly</i> had made offing at a lively pace
      during her wild gallop under the impetus of the easterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo balanced himself on the keel and took a long survey of the horizon.
      In one place a thread of blue, almost as delicate as the tracery of a vein
      on a girl's arm, suggested shore line. But without a glass he was not
      sure. He saw no sign of any other craft; the storm had driven all coasters
      to harbor&mdash;and there was not wind enough as yet to help them out to
      sea again. But he did not worry; he was sure that something, some yacht or
      sea-wagon, would come rolling up over the rim of the ocean before long.
      The faint breeze which fanned their faces was from the southwest, and that
      fact promised wind enough to invite shipping to spread canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the oval of the schooner's broad bilge showed above water, and the
      old Polly was so flat and tubby that their floating islet afforded only
      scant freeboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo shoved his arm down into the hole through which they had escaped.
      After the air had been forced out the lumber was within reach from the
      schooner's bottom. He fumbled about and found the ax. Some of the short
      bits of lumber which they had used as battering-rams were in the jaws of
      the hole. He busied himself with hewing these ends of planks into big
      wedges and he drove them into cracks between the planks near the keel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may come to be a bit sloppy when this sou'wester gets its gait on,&rdquo; he
      suggested to the skipper. &ldquo;We'll have something to hang on to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage's first thankfulness had shown a radiant gloss. But he was
      a sailorman, he was cautious, he was naturally apprehensive regarding all
      matters of the sea, and that gloss was now dulled a bit by his second
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may have to hang on to something longer 'n we reckon on. We're too far
      off for the coasters and too far in for the big fellers. And unless
      something comes pretty clost to us we can't be seen no more 'n as if we
      was mussels on a tide reef. We'd ought to have something to stick up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we could only work out one of those long joists it would make a little
      show.&rdquo; Captain Mayo shoved his arm down the hole again. &ldquo;But they are
      wedged across too solidly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there's a piece of lumber floating over there,&rdquo; cried the girl.
      She was clinging to one of the wedges, and the composure which she felt,
      or had assumed, stirred Mayo's admiration. The plump hand which she held
      against her forehead to shield her eyes did not tremble. From the little
      Dutch cap, under the edge of which stray locks peeped, down over her
      attire to her toes, she seemed to be still trim and trig, in spite of her
      experiences below in the darkness and the wet. With a sort of mild
      interest in her, he reflected that her up-country beau would be very
      properly proud of her if he could see her there on that schooner's keel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a picture you would make, Miss Candage, just as you are!&rdquo; he
      blurted. She took down her hand, and the look she gave him did not
      encourage compliments. &ldquo;Just as you are, and call it 'The Wreck,'&rdquo; he
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I look as badly as all that, Captain Mayo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look&mdash;&rdquo; he expostulated, and hesitated, for her gaze was
      distinctly not reassuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't tell me, please, how I look. I'm thankful that I have no mirror.
      Isn't that a piece of lumber?&rdquo; she inquired, crisply, putting a stop on
      further personalities. &ldquo;Wait! It's down in a hollow just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sea lifted it again immediately. Mayo saw that it was a long strip of
      scantling, undoubtedly from the deckload that the <i>Polly</i> had
      jettisoned when she was tripped. It lay to windward, and that fact
      promised its recovery; but how was the tide? Mayo squinted at the sun, did
      a moment's quick reckoning from the tide time of the day before, and
      smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll get that, Miss Candage. She's coming this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Watching it, seeing it lift and sink, waiting for it, helped to pass the
      time. Then at last it came alongside, and he crawled cautiously down the
      curve of the bilge and secured it. After he had braced it in the hole in
      the schooner's bottom with the help of Mr. Speed, the girl gave him a
      crumpled wad of cloth when he turned from his task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the rest of my petticoat. You may as well have it,&rdquo; she explained, a
      pretty touch of pink confusion in her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Speed boosted Mayo and the young man attached the cloth to the
      scantling and flung their banner to the breeze. Then there was not much to
      do except to wait, everlastingly squinting across the bright sea to the
      horizon's edge.

      X ~ HOSPITALITY, PER JULIUS MARSTON
    </h2>

     Hoo&mdash;oo&mdash;rah;  and up she rises!
     Hoo&mdash;oo&mdash;rah!  and up she rises!
          Early in the morning.
     What shall we do with a saucy sailor?
     Put him in the long boat and make him bail 'erv
          Early in the morn&mdash;ing!
                        &mdash;Old &ldquo;Stamp-and-go.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Mayo saw the sail first. It was coming in from the sea, and was very far
      and minute. He pointed it out with an exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you make it, sir?&rdquo; asked Captain Candage. &ldquo;Your eyes are younger
      'n mine are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon it's a fisherman bound in from Cashes Banks. He seems to be
      lying well over, and that shows there's a good breeze outside. He ought to
      reach near enough to see us, judging from the way he's heading.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That little sail, nicked against the sky, was something else to watch and
      speculate on and wait for, and they forgot, almost, that they were hungry
      and thirsty and sun-parched.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Captain Mayo kept his own gaze most steadfastly on the landward
      horizon. He did not reveal any of his thoughts, for he did not want to
      raise false hopes. Nevertheless, it was firmly in his mind that no matter
      what might be the sentiments of Julius Marston in regard to his recent
      skipper, the mate and engineer on board the <i>Olenia</i> were loyal
      friends who would use all their influence with the owner to urge him to
      come seeking the man who had been lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that a motor-boat had come popping out of Saturday Cove in
      pursuit of the schooner suggested that Mate McGaw had suspected what had
      happened, and was not dragging the cove-bottom for a drowned man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo had plenty of time for pondering on the matter, and he allowed hope
      to spice his guesses. He knew Mate McGaw's characteristics and decided
      that the yacht would get under way early, would nose into a few near-by
      harbors where a gale-ridden schooner might have dodged for safety, and
      then would chase down the sea, following the probable course of a craft
      which had been caught in that nor'easter. Mate McGaw was a sailorly man
      and understood how to fit one fact with another. He had a due portion of
      mariner's imagination, and was not the sort to desert a chum, even if he
      were obliged to use stiff speech to convert an owner. Therefore, Mayo
      peered toward the blue shore-line, coddling hope. He wondered whether Mate
      McGaw would have courage to slip a word of encouragement to Alma Marston
      if she asked questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo was elated rather than astonished when he spied a smear of drab smoke
      and was able to determine that the craft which was puffing that smoke was
      heading out to sea, not crawling alongshore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a fisherman all right, and he's bound to come clost enough to make
      us out,&rdquo; stated Captain Candage, his steady gaze to southward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But here comes another fellow who is going to beat him to us,&rdquo; announced
      Captain Mayo, gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you make it?&rdquo; asked the skipper, blinking at the distant
      smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A yacht, probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh? A yacht! If that's what it is they'll most likely smash right past.
      They'll think we're out here on a fishing picnic, most like. That's about
      all these yacht fellers know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl gave her father a frown of protest, but Mayo smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think this one is different, sir. If I am not very much mistaken, that
      is the yacht <i>Olenia</i> and she is hunting me up. Mate McGaw is one of
      our best little guessers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour later he was able to assure them that the on-coming
      craft was the <i>Olenia</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good old Mate McGaw!&rdquo; he cried, rapturously. In his joy he wished he
      could make them his confidants, tell them who was waiting for him on board
      that yacht, make them understand what wonderful good fortune was his.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time&mdash;the long time that even a fast yacht seems to consume
      in covering distance to effect the rescue of those who are anxious&mdash;the
      Olenita's whistle hooted hoarsely to assure them that they had been seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same to you, Mate McGaw!&rdquo; choked Captain Mayo, swinging his cap in
      wide circles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing that things have come round as they have, I'm mighty glad for you,
      Captain Mayo,&rdquo; declared Candage. &ldquo;I ain't no kind of a hand to plaster a
      man all over with thanks&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want thanks, sir. We worked together to save our lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'm hoping that there won't be any hard feelings one way or the
      other. I have lost my schooner by my blasted foolishness. So I'll say
      good-by and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by?&rdquo; demanded Mayo, showing his astonishment. &ldquo;Why are you saying
      good-by to me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are going aboard your yacht.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rest of you are going there, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't for poor critters like us to go mussing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Captain Candage, I am the captain of that yacht, and I say
      that you are coming on board and stay until I can set you ashore at the
      handiest port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd just as lieve wait for that fisherman, sir. I'll feel more at home
      aboard him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to think of your daughter's condition first, Captain Candage.
      She needs a few comforts right away, and you won't find them on board a
      fisherman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the girt who sat on the keel, silent, looking away to sea.
      She seemed to show a strange lack of interest in the yacht. Her pretty
      face exhibited no emotion, but somehow she was a wistfully pathetic figure
      as she sat there. Mayo's countenance showed much more concern than she
      expressed when she faced about at the sound of his voice and looked at
      him. Color came into his cheeks; there was embarrassment in his eyes, a
      queer hesitancy in his tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a young lady&mdash;there are several young ladies&mdash;but
      there is Mr. Marston's daughter!&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;She is on the yacht. I&mdash;I
      know she will do all she can for you. She will be good to you!&rdquo; His eyes
      fell under her frank and rather quizzical gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She might not care to be bothered with such a ragamuffin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can speak for her!&rdquo; he cried, eagerly. He was now even more disturbed
      by the glance she gave him. He had read that women have intuition in
      affairs of the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite certain you can, Captain Mayo,&rdquo; she assured him, demurely.
      &ldquo;And I am grateful. But perhaps we'd be better off on board that other
      vessel&mdash;father and the rest of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insist,&rdquo; he said, but he did not dare to meet her searching eyes. &ldquo;I
      insist!&rdquo; he repeated, resuming the decisive manner which he had shown
      before on board the <i>Polly</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Olenia</i>, slowing down, had come close aboard, and her churning
      screws pulled her to a standstill. Her crew sent a tender rattling down
      from her port davits. As she rolled on the surge her brass rails caught
      the sunlight in long flashes which fairly blinded the hollow eyes of the
      castaways. The white canvas of bridge and awnings gleamed in snowy purity.
      She was so near that Dolph smelled the savory scents from her galley and
      began to &ldquo;suffle&rdquo; moisture in the corners of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      They who waited on the barnacled hulk of the Polly, faint with hunger,
      bedraggled with brine, unkempt and wholly miserable after a night of toils
      and vigil, felt like beggars at a palace gate as they surveyed her
      immaculateness.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sort of insolent opulence seemed to exude from her. Mayo, her captain
      though he was, felt that suggestion of insolence more keenly than his
      companions, for he had had bitter and recent experience with the moods of
      Julius Marston.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not find Marston a comforting object for his gaze; the
      transportation magnate was pacing the port alley with a stride that was
      plainly impatient. Close beside the gangway stood Alma Marston, spotless
      in white duck. Each time her father turned his back on her she put out her
      clasped hands toward her lover with a furtive gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polly Candage watched this demonstration with frank interest, and
      occasionally stole side-glances at the face of the man who stood beside
      her on the schooner's bottom; he was wholly absorbed in his scrutiny of
      the other girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mate McGaw himself was at the tiller of the tender. His honest face was
      working with emotion, and he began to talk before the oarsmen had eased
      the boat against the overturned hulk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't closed my eyes, Captain Mayo. Stayed up all night, trying to
      figure it out. Almost gave up all notion that you were aboard the
      schooner. You didn't hail the boat we sent out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to do it; perhaps you couldn't hear me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage's countenance showed gratitude and relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning I tried Lumbo and two other shelters, and then chased along
      the trail of the blow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo trod carefully down the bilge and clasped the mate's hand. &ldquo;I was
      looking for you, Mr. McGaw. I know what kind of a chap you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McGaw, still holding to the captain's hand, spoke in lower tones. &ldquo;Had a
      devil of a time with the owner, sir. He was bound to have it that you had
      deserted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid he would think something of the sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate showed frank astonishment. &ldquo;You was afraid of <i>what?</i> Why,
      sir, I wanted to tell him that he was a crazy man to have any such ideas
      about you! Yes, sir, I came nigh telling him that! I would have done it if
      I hadn't wanted to keep mild and meek whilst I was arguing with him and
      trying to make him give me leave to search!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have had a terrible time of it, Mr. McGaw,&rdquo; stated Mayo, avoiding the
      mate's inquisitiveness. &ldquo;I am going to take these folks on board and set
      them ashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, sir, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two of them stood with clasped hands and held the tender close to the
      wreck until the passengers embarked. When they reached the foot of the <i>Olenia</i>'s
      steps Captain Mayo sent his guests ahead of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marston paused in his march and scowled, and the folks on the quarter-deck
      crowded to the rail, showing great interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo exchanged a long look with Alma Marston when he came up the
      steps. Love, pity, and greeting were in his eyes. Her countenance revealed
      her vivid emotions; she was overwrought, unstrung, half-crazed after a
      night spent with her fears. When he came within her reach caution was torn
      from her as gossamer is flicked away by a gale. Impulse had always
      governed her; she gave way to it then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;I love you. They may as well know it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before he understood her intentions or could prevent her rashness she
      flung her arms about his neck and kissed him repeatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marston stood in his tracks like a man stricken by paralysis; his cigar
      dropped from his open mouth. This exhibition under his very nose, with his
      guests and the whole crew of his yacht looking on, fairly stunned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had died I would have died!&rdquo; she wailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then her father plunged toward her, elbowing the astonished Beveridge out
      of his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo gently unhooked the arms of the frantic girl from about his
      neck and stepped forward, putting himself between father and daughter. He
      was not taking sensible thought in the matter; he was prompted by an
      instinctive impulse to protect her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo had no word ready at his tongue's end, and Mar-ston's anathema was
      muffled and incoherent. The girl's rash act had tipped over the sane and
      manly self-possession of both of them. The captain was too bewildered to
      comprehend the full enormity of his action in standing guard over the
      daughter of Julius Marston, as if she needed protection on her father's
      quarter-deck. He did not move to one side of the alley when Marston jerked
      an impatient gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to say that I am wholly to blame, sir,&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;I hope you
      will overlook&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you presuming to discuss my daughter's insanity with me?&rdquo; He noticed
      that the sailors were preparing to hoist the tender to the davits. &ldquo;Drop
      that boat back into the water!&rdquo; he shouted. There was an ugly rasp in his
      voice, and for a moment it seemed as if he were about to lose control of
      himself. Then he set a check on his temper and tongue, though his face was
      deathly white and his eyes were as hard as marbles. Resolve to end further
      exhibition in this incredible business dominated his wrathful shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will set us ashore&mdash;&rdquo; pleaded Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get back into that boat, you and your gang, whatever it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Marston, this young woman needs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get into that boat, or I'll have the bunch of you thrown overboard!&rdquo; The
      owner spoke in low tones, but his furious determination was apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go without being thrown, sir. Will you order us set aboard that
      fisherman?&rdquo; He pointed to the little schooner which was almost within
      hailing distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get off! I don't care where you go!&rdquo; He crowded past Mayo, seized his
      daughter's arm, and led her aft.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to have expended all her determination in her sensational
      outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain met her pleading gaze as she turned to leave. &ldquo;It's for the
      best,&rdquo; he declared, bravely. &ldquo;I'll make good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pathetic castaways from the <i>Polly</i> made a little group at the
      gangway, standing close to the rail, as if they feared to step upon the
      white deck. Mate McGaw intercepted Mayo as he was about to join them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn't I better stretch Section Two of the collision act a mite and scare
      him with the prospect of a thousand-dollar fine?&rdquo; asked the mate, eagerly.
      &ldquo;My glory, Captain Mayo, I'm so weak I can hardly stand up! Who'd have
      thought it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll go aboard the schooner, Mr. McGaw. It's the place for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe it is, but I'll speak up if you say the word, and make him set you
      ashore&mdash;even if I leave along with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your job, sir. Will you pick up my few little belongings in my
      stateroom and bring them to me, Mr. McGaw? I'd better stay here on deck
      with my friends.&rdquo; He emphasized the last word, and Captain Candage gave
      him a grateful look. &ldquo;I'm sorry, mates! I can't say any more!&rdquo; Captain
      Mayo did not allow himself to make further comment on the melancholy
      situation. The others were silent; the affair was out of their reckoning;
      they had no words to fit the case. Polly Candage stood looking out to sea.
      He had hoped that she would give him a glance of understanding sympathy,
      at least. But she did not, not even when he helped her down the steps into
      the tender.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mate McGaw came with the captain's bag and belongings, and promptly
      received orders from the owner from the quarter-deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on to the bridge and hail that schooner. Tell her we are headed for
      New York and can't be bothered by these persons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McGaw grasped Mayo's hand in farewell, and then he hurried to his
      duty. His megaphoned message echoed over their heads while the tender was
      on its way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, sir!&rdquo; returned the fishing-skipper, with hearty bellow. &ldquo;Glad to
      help sailors in trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that shows you&mdash;&rdquo; blurted Captain Candage, and stopped his say
      in the middle of his outburst when his daughter shoved a significant fist
      against his ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo turned his head once while the tender was hastening toward
      the schooner. But there were no women in sight on the yacht's deck. There
      was an instant's flutter of white from a stateroom port, but he was not
      sure whether it was a handkerchief or the end of a wind-waved curtain. He
      faced about resolutely and did not look behind again. Shame, misery,
      hopelessness&mdash;he did not know which emotion was stinging him most
      poignantly. The oarsmen in the tender were gazing upward innocently while
      they rowed, but he perceived that they were hiding grins. His humiliation
      in that amazing fashion would be the forecastle jest. Through him these
      new friends of his had been subjected to insult. He felt that he
      understood what Polly Candage's silence meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment he felt the pat of a little hand on the fist he was
      clenching on his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I understand! It will come out right if you
      don't lose courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she was not looking at him when he gave her a quick side-glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fisherman had come into the wind, rocking on the long swell, dingy
      sails flapping, salt-stained sides dipping and flashing wet gleams as she
      rolled. Her men were rigging a ladder over the side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to say whilst we're here together and there's time to say it,&rdquo;
       announced Captain Candage, &ldquo;that we are one and all mighty much obliged
      for that invite you gave us to come aboard the yacht, sir, and we all know
      that if&mdash;well, if things had been different from what they was you
      would have used us all right. And what I might say about yachts and the
      kind of critters that own 'em I ain't a-going to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are improving right along, father,&rdquo; observed Polly Candage, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, I have my own idees on the subject. But that's neither here nor
      there. You're a native and I'm a native, and I want ye should just look at
      that face leaning over the lee rail, there, and then say that now we know
      that we're among real friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a rubicund and welcoming countenance under the edge of a rusty
      black oilskin sou'wester hat, and the man was manifestly the skipper.
      Every once in a while he flourished his arm encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hearty welcome aboard the <i>Reuben and Esther</i>,&rdquo; he called out when
      the tender swung to the foot of the ladder. &ldquo;What schooner is she, there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old <i>Polly</i>,&rdquo; stated the master, first up the ladder. In his
      haste to greet the fishing-skipper he left his daughter to the care of
      Captain Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's too bad&mdash;too bad!&rdquo; clucked the fishing-skipper, full measure
      of sympathy in his demeanor. &ldquo;She was old, but she was able, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here's another poor Polly,&rdquo; stated Captain Candage. &ldquo;I was fool
      enough to take her out of a good home for a trip to sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The skipper ducked salute. &ldquo;Make yourself to home, miss. Go below. House
      is yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the schooner lurched away on her shoreward tack, and the insolent
      yacht marched off down across the shimmering waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo shook hands with the solicitous fisherman in rather dreamy and
      indifferent fashion. He realized that he was faint with hunger, but he
      refused to eat. Fatigue and grief demanded their toll in more imperious
      fashion than hunger. He lay down in the sun in the lee alley, put his head
      on his crossed arms, and blessed sleep blotted out his bitter thoughts.

      XI ~ A VOICE FROM HUE AND CRY
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      But when the money's all gone and spent,
      And there's none to be borrowed and none to be lent,
      In comes old Grouchy with a frown,
      Saying, &ldquo;Get up, Jack, let John sit down.&rdquo;
            For it's now we're outward bound,
           Hur-rah, we're outward bound!
                        &mdash;Song of the Dog and Bell.
</pre>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo, when he woke, had it promptly conveyed to him that
      hospitality on board the <i>Reuben and Esther</i> had watchful eyes. While
      he was rubbing feeling back into his stiffened limbs, sitting there in the
      lee alley, the cook came lugging a pot of hot coffee and a plate heaped
      with food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought you'd rather have it here than in the cuddy. The miss is asleep
      in the house,&rdquo; whispered the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage came to Mayo while the latter was eating and sat down on
      the deck. Gloom had settled on the schooner's master. &ldquo;I don't want to
      bother you with my troubles, seeing that you've got aplenty of your own,
      sir. But I'm needing a little advice. I have lost a schooner that has been
      my home ever since I was big enough to heave a dunnage-bag over the rail,
      and not a cent of insurance. Insurance would have et up all my profits.
      What do you think of my chances to make a dollar over and above providing
      I hire a tugboat and try to salvage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;According to my notion your chances would be poor, sir. Claims in such
      cases usually eat up all a craft is worth. Besides, you may find those
      yachtsmen on your back for damages, providing you get her in where she can
      be libeled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't wonder a mite,&rdquo; admitted Captain Can-dage. &ldquo;The more some
      folks have the more they keep trying to git.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was looking her bottom over while we sat there, and it must be owned up
      that her years have told on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate to let her go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's natural, sir. But I have an idea that she will be reported as a
      menace to navigation, and that a coastguard cutter will blow her up before
      you can get around to make your salvage arrangements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a man is down they all jump on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can agree with you there,&rdquo; affirmed Captain Mayo, mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She showed grit&mdash;that girl,&rdquo; ventured Candage, giving the other man
      keen survey from under his grizzled brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must ask you to furl sail on that subject, sir,&rdquo; snapped Mayo, with
      sailor bluntness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only said it complimentary. Lots of times girls have more grit than
      they are given credit for. You think they're just girls, and then you find
      out that they are hero-ines! I thought I had some grit, but my own Polly
      has shamed me. I was just down watching her&mdash;she's asleep in Cap'n
      Sinnett's bunk. Made the tears come up into my eyes, sir, to ponder on
      what she has been through on account of my cussed foolishness. Of course,
      you haven't been told. But confession is good for a man, and I'm going to
      own up. I took her with me to get her away from a fellow who is courting
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo did not offer comment. He wanted to advise the skipper to keep still
      on that subject, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't say he ain't good enough for her. Maybe he is. But I 'ain't been
      realizing that she has growed up. When I found she was being courted it
      was like hitting a rock in a fairway. You are young, and you are around
      consid'able and know the actions of young folks. What's your advice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know anything about the circumstances, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But speaking generally,&rdquo; insisted Captain Candage. &ldquo;I want to do what's
      right. There ain't many I can bring myself to ask. I'm a poor old fool,
      I'm afraid. Won't you kind of grab in on this, Captain Mayo? I do need a
      little advice.&rdquo; His rough hands trembled on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the young man is worthy&mdash;is the right sort,&rdquo; returned Mayo, in
      gentler tones, &ldquo;I think you are making a great mistake by interfering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go look that young fellow over&mdash;re-survey him, as ye might
      say,&rdquo; stated the skipper, after a moment's meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know your daughter very well, sir, but I have much faith in her
      judgment. If I were you I'd allow her to pick her own husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks for that advice. I know it comes from a man who has shown that he
      knows exactly what to do in emergencies. I have changed my mind about her
      being courted, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest love isn't a question of money, Captain Candage. Many good girls
      are ruined by&mdash;&rdquo; He was speaking bitterly and he checked himself.
      &ldquo;Where is Captain Sinnett going to set us ashore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maquoit. He is going to take his fish to the big market. But he said he
      would set us ashore anywhere, and so I said Maquoit. I might as well be
      there as anywhere till I know what I'm going to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same thing holds good for me, I suppose. I don't feel like going to the
      city just yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Sinnett came rolling into the alley, and when Mayo started to
      thank him for the trouble he was taking he raised in genial protest a hand
      which resembled in spread a split codfish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trouble! It ain't trouble. Was going to call into Maquoit to ice up,
      anyway. I know my manners even if them yachting fellows didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage preserved the demeanor of innocence under Mayo's scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've missed you off the fishing-grounds&mdash;didn't know you had gone on
      to a yacht, sir,&rdquo; pursued Captain Sinnett. &ldquo;Hope to see you back into the
      fishing business again; that is, providing you don't go on one of them
      beam trawlers that are hooking up the bottom of the Atlantic and sp'iling
      the thing entire for us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you about the trawler; that's why I quit. And as to
      yachting, I think I'll go after a real man's job, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do! You'll be contenteder,&rdquo; replied the other, significance in his
      tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo knew that his secret had been exposed, but he had no relish for an
      argument with Captain Candage on the subject of garrulity. He finished his
      coffee and went forward where the fishermen were coiling the gang-lines
      into the tubs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fisherman made port at Maquoit late in the afternoon, and was warped
      to her berth at the ice-house wharf.
    </p>
    <p>
      The castaways went ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maquoit was a straggling hamlet at the head of a cove which nicked the
      coast-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage, an Apple-treer, who knew every hole alongshore where
      refuge from stress of weather was afforded, led his party through the
      village with confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a widder here who will put us up for what time we want to stay&mdash;and
      be glad of the money. I knowed her husband in the coasting trade. I like
      to get into a place like this that 'ain't been sp'iled by them cussed
      rusticators and the prices they are willing to pay,&rdquo; he confided to Mayo.
      He slyly exhibited a wallet that was stuffed with paper money. &ldquo;I ain't
      busted, but there's no sense in paying more 'n five dollars a week
      anywhere for vittles and bed. She will make plenty off'n us at that rate.
      You just let me do the dickering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The widow proved to be a kindly soul who, in the first excitement of her
      sympathetic nature, resolutely refused to consider the matter of any
      payment whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are shipwrecked, and my poor husband's body wouldn't rest quiet
      wherever it is in the Atlantic Ocean if I grabbed money from shipwrecked
      folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, in the end, Captain Candage worked her up from three dollars to
      five per week, and she took Polly Candage into her heart and into the best
      chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo came back to supper after a moody stroll about the village.
      Skipper Candage was patrolling the widow's front yard and was exhibiting
      more cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's God's Proverdunce and your grit that has saved us, sir. I have come
      out of my numb condition and sense it all. What's your plans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't seem to be able to make any just yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to stay right here for a spell, and shall keep Dolph and Otie
      with me. We shall be here on the coast where we can hear of something to
      grab in on. As soon as Polly gets straightened around I'll let her go home
      to her aunt. But, of course, hanging around here doesn't offer you any
      attractions, sir. You're looking for bigger game than we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have about made up my mind to leave in the morning on the stage. I'll
      go somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The widow tapped her knuckles on the glass of a near-by window. &ldquo;Supper!&rdquo;
       she announced. &ldquo;Hurry in whilst it's hot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always do my best pondering on a full stomach,&rdquo; said Captain Candage.
      &ldquo;And I smell cream-o'-tartar biskits and I saw her hulling field
      strorb'ries. Better look on the bright side of things along with me,
      Captain Mayo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo failed to find any bright side as he turned his affairs over
      in his mind. He had only a meager stock of money. He had used his modest
      earnings in settling the debts of the family estate. The outlook for
      employment was vague&mdash;he could not estimate to what extent the
      hostility of Julius Marston might block his efforts, provided the magnate
      troubled himself to descend to meddle with the affairs of such an
      inconspicuous person. His poor little romance with Alma Marston had been
      left in a shocking condition. He did not talk at the supper-table, and the
      widow's wholesome food was like ashes in his mouth. He went out and sat on
      the porch of the widow's cottage and looked into the sunset and saw
      nothing in its rosy hues to give him encouragement for his own future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polly Candage came timidly and sat down beside him. &ldquo;Father says you think
      of leaving in the morning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing for me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long silence followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you don't care to have me talk to you, Captain Mayo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll listen to you gratefully, any time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm only a country girl. I don't know how to say it&mdash;how to tell you
      I'm so sorry for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That one little pat on my hand to-day, it was better than words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all I can think about&mdash;your unhappiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That touches me because I know that you have enough sorrow of your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorrow!&rdquo; She opened her eyes wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I have no business speaking of it,&rdquo; he returned, with
      considerable embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet I have been so bold as to speak to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a touch of reproach in her voice, and therefore he ventured:
      &ldquo;Your father told me&mdash;I tried to stop him, but he went on and said&mdash;Well,
      I understand! But I have some consolation for you and I'm going to speak
      out. He says he is going to allow you to marry your young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he dare to talk such matters over with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He insisted on doing it&mdash;on asking my advice. So I advised in a way
      to help you. I am glad, for your sake, that he is coming to his senses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you for your help,&rdquo; she said, stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it's none of my business. I'm sorry he told me. But I wish you
      all happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose as if to go away. Then she stamped her foot and sat down. &ldquo;My
      father ought to be muzzled!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She realized that he might misinterpret her indignation, for he said: &ldquo;I'm
      ashamed because I meddled in your affairs. But from what you saw to-day in
      my case, I felt that I ought to help others who are in the same trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my father has mistaken my&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off in much confusion,
      not understanding the queer look he gave her. &ldquo;I&mdash;I am glad my father
      is coming to his senses and will allow me to&mdash;to&mdash;marry the
      young man,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;And now I think I may be allowed to say that I
      hope you may have the girl you love, some day. Would you like to have me
      talk to you about her&mdash;how dear and pretty I think she is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it hurts! But I do want you to know, Miss Can-dage, that I'm not out
      fortune-hunting. I love her for herself&mdash;just herself&mdash;nothing
      more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it must be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I know that a young man you would choose is worthy of you. I told
      your father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter. <i>That</i> hurts, too! We both understand. We'll leave it
      there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the declaration of that truce they were frankly at ease and began to
      chat with friendly freedom. The dusk came shading into the west, the
      evening star dripped silver light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a peaceful spot here,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;Everybody seems to be
      contented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Contentment&mdash;in a rut&mdash;that may be the best way of passing this
      life, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you were in the rut, Captain Mayo, you might find that contentment
      would not agree to come and live with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably it wouldn't! I'd have to be born to the life here like this chap
      who is coming up the hill. You can see that he isn't worrying about
      himself or the world outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man was clumping slowly along in his rubber boots; an old cap was
      slewed awry on his head, its peak drawn down over one ear. He cocked up
      the other ear at sound of voices on the porch and loafed up and sat down
      on the edge of the boarding. Captain Mayo and the girl, accustomed to
      bland indifference to formality in rural neighborhoods, accepted this
      interruption without surprise or protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tain't a bad night as nights go,&rdquo; stated the caller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a beautiful night,&rdquo; said Polly Candage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon it seems so to you, after what you went through. I've been
      harking to your father telling the yarn down to the store.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They did not reply, having their own ideas as to Captain Candage's
      loquacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The caller hauled a plug of tobacco from his pocket, gnawed off a chew,
      and began slow wagging of his jaws. &ldquo;This world is full of trouble,&rdquo; he
      observed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to be,&rdquo; agreed Captain Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them what's down get kicked further down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also true, in many cases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your case! It's bad. But our'n is worse!&rdquo; The caller pointed to the
      dim bulk of a small island which the cove held between the bold jaws of
      its headland. &ldquo;The old sir who named that Hue and Cry Island must have
      smelt into the future so as to know what was going to happen there some
      day&mdash;and this is the day!&rdquo; He chewed on, and his silence became
      irritating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what has happened?&rdquo; demanded the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hasn't happened just yet&mdash;it's going to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Further silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us what's going to happen, can't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I can, now that you have asked me. I ain't no hand to butt in.
      I ain't no hand to do things unless I'm asked. There's seventeen fam'lies
      of us on Hue and Cry and they've told us to get off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The state! Some big bugs come along and said the Governor sent 'em, and
      they showed papers and we've got to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I know about Hue and Cry!&rdquo; protested Mayo. &ldquo;You people have lived
      there for years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure have! My grandfather was one of the first settlers. Most all of us
      who live there had grandfathers who settled the place. But according to
      what is told us, some heirs have found papers what say that they own the
      island. The state bought out the heirs. Now the state says get off. We're
      only squatters, state says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, good Caesar, man, you have squatter rights after all these years.
      Hire a lawyer. Fight the case!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ain't fighters. 'Ain't got no money&mdash;'ain't got no friends. Might
      have fit plain heirs, but you can't fight the state&mdash;leastways, poor
      cusses like us can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's the problem! That's what made me say that this world is
      full of trouble. You see, we have taken town help in years past&mdash;had
      to do it or starve winters. And we have had state aid, too. They say that
      makes paupers of us. Every town round about has served notice that we
      can't settle there and gain pauper residence. Hue and Cry 'ain't ever been
      admitted to any town. Towns say, seeing that the state has ordered us off,
      now let the state take care of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And men have been here, representing the state?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet they have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say get off! But they won't let us settle on the main. Looks like they
      wanted us to go up in balloons. But we hain't got no balloons. Got to
      move, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard of such a thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I, neither,&rdquo; admitted this man, with a sort of calm numbness of
      discouragement. &ldquo;But that ain't anyways surprising. We don't hear much
      about anything on Hue and Cry till they come and tell us. Speaking for
      myself, I ain't so awful much fussed up. I've got a house-bo't to take my
      wife and young ones on, and we'll keep on digging clams for trawlers&mdash;sixty
      cents a bucket, shucked, and we can dig and shuck a bucket a day, all
      hands turning to. We won't starve. But I pity the poor critters that
      'ain't got a house-bo't. Looks like they'd need wings. I ain't worrying a
      mite, I say. I had the best house on the island, and the state has allowed
      a hundred and fifty dollars for it. I consider I'm well fixed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The plutocrat of the unhappy tribe of Hue and Cry rose and stretched with
      a comfortable grunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it ain't one thing it's another,&rdquo; he said, as he started off. &ldquo;We've
      got to have about so much trouble, anyway, and it might just as well be
      this as anything else.&rdquo; %
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that's an awful thing to happen to those people!&rdquo; declared the girl.
      &ldquo;I must say, he takes it calmly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a fair sample of some of the human jellyfish I have found hidden
      away in odd corners on this coast,&rdquo; stated Captain Mayo. &ldquo;Not enough mind
      or spirit left to fight for his own protection. But this thing is almost
      unbelievable. It can't be possible that the state is gunning an affair
      like this! I'll find somebody who knows more about it than that
      clam-digging machine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little later a man strolled past, hands behind his back. He was placidly
      smoking a cigar, and, though the dusk had deepened, Mayo could perceive
      that he was attired with some pretensions to city smartness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; called the young man. &ldquo;But do you know anything
      about the inwardness of this business on Hue and Cry Island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you <i>all</i> about it,&rdquo; stated the person who had been
      hailed. He sauntered up and sat down on the edge of the porch. He showed
      the air of a man who was killing time. &ldquo;I'm in charge of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not of putting those people off the island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! That's what I'm here for. I'm state agent on pauper affairs, acting
      for the Governor and Council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say the state is back of this?&rdquo; demanded Mayo, incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly! It's a matter that the state was obliged to take up. State has
      bought that island from the real heirs, has ordered off those squatters,
      and we shall burn down their shacks and clear the land up. Of course, we
      allow heads of families some cash for their houses, if you can call 'em
      houses. That's under the law regulating squatter improvements. But
      improvements is a polite word for the buildings on that island. It is
      going to cost us good money to clear up for that New York party who has
      made an offer to the state&mdash;he's going to use the island for a summer
      estate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flicked the ashes from his cigar and broke in on Mayo's indignant
      retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had to be done, sir. They have intermarried till a good many of the
      children are fools. The men are breaking into summer cottages, after the
      owners leave in the fall. They steal everything on the main that isn't
      nailed down. They have set false beacons in the winter, and have wrecked
      coasters. Every little while some city newspaper has written them up as
      wild men, and it has given the state a bad name. We're going to break up
      the nest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where will they go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fools to the state school for the feeble-minded, cripples to the
      poorhouse. The able-bodied will have to get out and go to work at
      something honest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, look here, my dear sir! Those poor devils are starting out with too
      much of a handicap. After three generations on that island they don't know
      how to get a living on the main.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's their own lookout, not the state's! State doesn't guarantee to
      give shiftless folks a living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about using a little common sense in the case of such people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not making this affair your business, are you?&rdquo; asked the
      commissioner, with acerbity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better not; and you'd better not say too much to <i>me!</i>&rdquo; He rose and
      dusted off his trousers. &ldquo;I have investigated for the Governor and Council
      and they are acting on my recommendations. You might just as well advise
      nursing and coddling a nest of brown-tail moths&mdash;and we are spending
      good money to kill off moths. We don't propose to encourage the breeding
      of thieves. We are not keeping show places of this sort along the coast
      for city folks to talk about and run down the state after they go back
      home. It hurts state business!&rdquo; He marched away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo strode up and down the porch and muttered some emphatic
      opinions in regard to the intellects and doings of rulers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, I know the sort of people who live on that island, Miss Candage.
      I have seen other cases alongshore. They are blamed for what they don't
      know&mdash;and what they are led into. Amateur missionaries will load them
      down in a spasm of summer generosity with a lot of truck and make them
      think that the world owes them a living. The poor devils haven't wit
      enough to look ahead. When it comes winter they are starving&mdash;and
      when children are hungry and cold a man will tackle a proposition that is
      more dangerous than a summer cottage locked up for the winter. Next comes
      along some chap like that state agent, who prides himself on being
      straight business and no favors! He puts the screws to 'em! There's nobody
      to help those folks in the real and the right way. I pity them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I live in the country and I know how unfeeling the boards of selectmen
      are in many of the pauper cases. When it's a matter of saving money for
      the voters and making a good town record, they don't care much how poor
      folks get along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo continued to patrol the porch. &ldquo;I'm in a rather rebellious state of
      mind just now, I reckon,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Seems to me that a lot of folks,
      including myself, are getting kicked. I'm smarting! I have a
      fellow-feeling for the oppressed.&rdquo; He laughed, but there was no merriment
      in his tones. &ldquo;It's the little children who will suffer most in this, Miss
      Candage,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;They are not to blame&mdash;they don't understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of course nothing can be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing sensible, I'm afraid.&rdquo; He walked to and fro for many minutes.
      &ldquo;You see, it's none of my business,&rdquo; he commented, when he came and sat
      down beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose there's not one man in the world to step forward and say a good
      word for them,&rdquo; said the girl, softly, uttering her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Words wouldn't amount to anything&mdash;with the machinery of the state
      grinding away so merrily as it is. But this matter is stirring my
      curiosity a little, Miss Candage. That's because I am one of the oppressed
      myself, I reckon.&rdquo; Again his mirthless chuckle. &ldquo;I intended to take the
      stage out of here in the morning, but I have an idea that I'll stay over
      and see what happens when that gentleman who represents our grand old
      state proceeds to scatter those folks to the four winds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was hoping you would stay over, Captain Mayo.&rdquo; She declared that with
      frank delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't expect me to do anything, of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not that. You see, I'd like to go down to the island and&mdash;and
      father is so odd he might not be willing to escort me,&rdquo; she explained,
      trying to be matter-of-fact, her air showing that she regretted her
      outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I volunteer, here and now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose and put out her hand to him. &ldquo;I have not thanked you for saving
      my life&mdash;saving us all, Captain Mayo. It is too holy a matter to be
      profaned by any words. But here is my hand&mdash;like a friend&mdash;like
      a sister&mdash;no&rdquo;&mdash;she held herself straight and looked him full in
      the face through the gloom and tightened her hold on his fingers&mdash;&ldquo;like
      a man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned her earnest finger-clasp and released her hand when her
      pressure slackened. That sudden spirit, the suggestion that she desired to
      assume the attitude of man to man with him, seemed to vanish from her with
      the release of her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She quavered her &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; There was even a hint of a sob. Then she
      ran into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo stared after her, wrinkling his forehead for a moment, as if he had
      discovered some new vagary in femininity to puzzle him. Then he resumed
      his patrol with the slow stride of the master mariner. Hue and Cry raised
      dim bulk in the harbor jaws, showing no glimmer of light. It was barren,
      treeless, a lump of land which towns had thrust from them and which county
      boundaries had not taken in. He admitted that the state had good reasons
      for desiring to change conditions on Hue and Cry, but this callous, brutal
      uprooting of helpless folks who had been attached to that soil through
      three generations was so senselessly radical that his resentment was
      stirred. It was swinging from the extreme of ill-considered indulgence to
      that of utter cruelty, and the poor devils could not in the least
      understand!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There seem to be other things than a spiked martingale which can pick a
      man up and keep him away from his own business,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;What fool
      notion possesses me to go out there to-morrow I cannot understand.
      However, I can go and look on without butting into stuff that's no affair
      of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two men were shuffling past in the road. In the utter silence of that
      summer night their conversation carried far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, as I was saying, there he lays dead! When I was with him on the
      <i>Luther Briggs</i> he fell from the main crosstrees, broke both legs and
      one arm, and made a dent in the deck, and he got well. And a week ago,
      come to-morrow, he got a sliver under his thumb, and there he lays dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the way it often is in life. Whilst a man is looking up into the sky
      so as to see the big things and dodge 'em, he goes to work and stubs his
      toe over a knitting-needle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; Captain Mayo informed himself; &ldquo;but I can't seem to help
      myself, somehow!&rdquo;

     Don't you hear the old man roaring, Johnny,
          One more day? Don't you hear that pilot bawling,

</pre>
    <p>
      When the subject of the proposed expedition to Hue and Cry was broached at
      the breakfast-table, Captain Epps Candage displayed prompt interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's going to be a good thing for the section round about here&mdash;roust
      'em off! Heard 'em talking it over down to Rowley's store last evening.
      I'll go along with you and see it done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo and Polly Candage exchanged looks and refrained from comment. It was
      evident that Captain Candage reflected the utilitarian view of Maquoit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo had put off that hateful uniform of Marston's yacht, and the girl
      gave him approving survey when he appeared that morning in his shore suit
      of quiet gray. With the widow's ready aid Polly Candage had made her own
      attire presentable once more. When they walked down to the shore she
      smiled archly at Mayo from under the brim of a very fetching straw poke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ran down to the general store early and bought a boy's hat,&rdquo; she
      explained. &ldquo;I trimmed it myself. You know, I'm a milliner's apprentice.
      Does it do my training credit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was somewhat warm in his assurances that it did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to be pleased by your praise,&rdquo; she said, demurely, &ldquo;because women
      wear hats for men's approval, and if my customers go home and hear such
      nice words from their husbands my business career is sure to be a
      success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your business career?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir!&rdquo; She bobbed a little courtesy. &ldquo;I have money, sir! Money
      of my own. Five thousand dollars in the bank, if you please! Oh, you need
      not stare at me. I did not earn it. My dear mother's sister left it to me
      in her will. And some day when you are walking down the city street you'll
      see a little brass sign&mdash;very bright, very neat&mdash;and there'll be
      'Polly' on it. Then you may come up and call on the great milliner&mdash;that
      will be this person, now so humble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that young man!&rdquo; he protested, smiling at her gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that young man?&rdquo; She wrinkled her nose. Then she flushed, conscious
      that he was a bit surprised at her tone of disdain. &ldquo;Why, he will wear a
      frock-coat and a flower in the buttonhole and will bow in my customers.
      You didn't think my young man was a farmer-boy, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hurried ahead of him to the beach, where her father was waiting with
      his men. Captain Candage had borrowed a dory for the trip. He installed
      himself in the stern with the steer-oar, and the young man and the girl
      sat together on the midship seat. The skipper listened to their chat with
      bland content.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a fellow that's one of our kind, and he ain't trying to court my
      girl,&rdquo; he had confided to Mr. Speed. &ldquo;He is spoke for and she knows it.
      And under them circumstances I believe in encouraging young folks to be
      sociable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was still early morning when they arrived at the island, but the state
      agent was there ahead of them. They saw him walking briskly about among
      the scattered houses, puffing on his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was making domiciliary visits and was transacting business in a loud
      tone of voice. That business was paying over the money which the state had
      allowed for &ldquo;squatter improvements.&rdquo; In the case of the settlers on Hue
      and Cry the sums were mere pittances; their improvements consisted of
      tottering shacks, erected from salvaged flotsam of the ocean and patched
      over and over with tarred paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one building on the island which deserved
    </p>
    <p>
      the name of dwelling; from this their communicative caller of the
      preceding evening was removing his scant belongings. His wife and children
      were helping. He set down a battered table when he met Mayo and his party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm the only citizen who can get away early and&mdash;as you might call
      it&mdash;respectable, gents. I took my hundred and fifty and bought that
      house-bo't out there.&rdquo; It was an ancient scow, housed over, and evidently
      had grown venerable in service as a floating fish-market. &ldquo;They can't
      drive me off'n the Atlantic Ocean! The others 'ain't woke up to a
      reelizing sense that they have got to go and that this all means business!
      I'm getting away early or else they'd all be trying to climb aboard my
      bo't like the folks wanted to do to Noah's ark when they see that the
      flood wasn't just a shower.&rdquo; He lifted his table upon his head and marched
      on, leading his flock.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the population of the island was out of doors. The women and the
      children were idling in groups; the men were listlessly following the
      commissioner on his rounds. No spirit of rebelliousness was evident. The
      men acted more like inquisitive sheep. They were of that abject variety of
      poor whites who accept the rains from heaven and bow to the reign of
      authority with the same unquestioning resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mayo discovered promptly an especial reason for the calmness exhibited
      by these men. Their slow minds had not wakened to full comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you men propose to do?&rdquo; demanded Captain Mayo of a group which
      had abandoned the commissioner and had strolled over to inspect the
      new-comers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain't nothing we can do,&rdquo; stated a spokesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don't you understand that this man is here with full power from the
      state to put you off this island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they have threated us before. But something has allus come up. We
      haven't been driv' off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this time it's going to happen! Why don't you wake up? Where are you
      going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's for somebody else to worry about. This ain't any of our picking
      and choosing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the use of trying to beat anything sensible through the shells of
      them quahaugs?&rdquo; snarled Captain Candage, with 'longcoast scorn for the
      inefficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much use, I'm afraid,&rdquo; acknowledged the young man. &ldquo;But look at the
      children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those pathetic waifs of Hue and Cry were huddled apart, dumb with terror
      which their elders made no attempt to calm. They were ragged, pitiful,
      wistful urchins; lads with pinched faces, poor little snippets of girls.
      Their childish imaginations made of the affair a tragedy which they could
      not understand. Under their arms they held frightened cats, helpless
      kittens, or rag dolls. The callous calm of the men mystified them; the
      weeping of their mothers made their miserable fear more acute. They stared
      from face to face, trying to comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I say to them?&rdquo; asked Polly Candage, in a whisper. &ldquo;It's wicked.
      They are so frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps something can be done with that agent. I'm trying to think up
      something to say to him,&rdquo; Mayo told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old man, a very old man, sat on an upturned clamhod and yawled a
      discordant miserere on a fiddle. His eyes were wide open and sightless. A
      woman whose tattered skirt only partly concealed the man's trousers and
      rubber boots which she wore, occasionally addressed him as &ldquo;father.&rdquo; She
      was piling about him a few articles of furniture which she was lugging out
      of their home; that house was the upper part of a schooner's cabin&mdash;something
      the sea had cast up on Hue and Cry. She was obliged to bend nearly double
      in order to walk about in the shelter. Dogs slinked between the feet of
      their masters, canine instinct informing them that something evil was
      abroad that day. The children staring wide-eyed and white-faced, the
      weeping women, the cowed men who shuffled and mumbled! Among them strode
      the god of the machine, curt, contemptuous, puffing his cigar! He came
      past Captain Mayo and his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; called the captain; &ldquo;but are you sure that you
      are doing this thing just right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's see&mdash;if I remember, I had a little talk with you last night!&rdquo;
       suggested the agent, frostily. &ldquo;Whom do you represent?&rdquo; &ldquo;Myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just how do you fit into this matter?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don't think I do fit&mdash;there
      seem to be too many sharp corners,&rdquo; stated Mayo, not liking the other's
      insolent manner. &ldquo;Well, I fit! I have state authority.&rdquo; &ldquo;So you have told
      me. May I ask you a question?&rdquo; &ldquo;Go ahead, but be lively. This is my busy
      day.&rdquo; &ldquo;These people are being rooted up; they don't seem to know what's to
      become of them. What will be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you last evening! Fools in an institution; able-bodied must go to
      work. The state proposes&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;When you say 'state' just what do you
      mean, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;I mean that I have investigated this matter and I'm running
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I thought! The state usually doesn't know much about what its
      agents are doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not doubting my authority, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I'm doubting your good judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, my man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'd better not lose our tempers,&rdquo; advised Mayo, calmly. &ldquo;You are a state
      servant, you say. Then a citizen has a right to talk to you. Let's leave
      the state out of this, if you question my right. Man to man, now! You're
      wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The population of the island had drawn close circle about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's enough talk from you,&rdquo; declared the agent, wrathfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are trying to make over all at once what it has taken three
      generations to bring about,&rdquo; insisted Mayo. &ldquo;You can't do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You watch me and see if I can't! When I transact any business I'm paid to
      transact it gets transacted. I might have given these people a few more
      days if you had not come sticking your oar in here. But now I propose to
      show you! I'll have 'em off here by nightfall, and every shack burned to
      the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say you're going to rub it into these poor folks just
      because I have tried to say something to help them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll show you and them that it isn't safe to monkey with the state when
      the state gets started.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the state be condemned!&rdquo; exploded Mayo, feeling his own temper
      getting away from him. &ldquo;This isn't the state&mdash;it's a case of a man's
      swelled head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get off this island, you and your meddlers,&rdquo; commanded the agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, when we are ready to leave, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo was wondering at his own obstinacy. He knew that a rather boyish
      temper, resentment roused by the other man's arrogance, had considerable
      to do with his stand in the matter, but underneath there was protest at
      the world's injustice. He felt that he had been having personal experience
      with that injustice. He knew that he had not come out to Hue and Cry to
      volunteer as the champion of these unfortunates, but now that he was there
      and had spoken out it was evident that he must allow himself to be forced
      into the matter to some extent; the agent had declared in the hearing of
      all that this interference had settled the doom of the islanders. Polly
      Candage was standing close to the champion, and she looked at him with
      eyes that flashed with pride in him and spirit of her own. She reached and
      took one of the frightened children by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have been a little hasty in my remarks I apologize,&rdquo; pleaded the
      captain, anxious to repair the fault. &ldquo;I don't mean to interfere with your
      duty. I have no right to do so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear what your friend says, after getting you into the mess,&rdquo; shouted
      the agent, so that all might hear. &ldquo;Now he is getting ready to trot away
      and leave you in your trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong there, my friend. If you are angry with me, go ahead and
      have your quarrel with me. Don't bang at me over the shoulders of these
      poor folks. It isn't a square deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They go off to-day&mdash;and they go because you have butted into the
      matter. The whole of you have got to be shown that the state doesn't stand
      for meddlers after orders have been given.&rdquo; Then he added, with malice:
      &ldquo;You folks better ride this chap down to the beach on a rail. Whatever
      happens to you is his fault!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This attempt to shift responsibility as a petty method of retaliation
      stirred Mayo's anger in good earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agent was dealing with men who were scarcely more than children in
      their estimates of affairs; they muttered among themselves and scowled on
      this stranger who had brought their troubles to a climax.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to allow you to get away with that kind of talk, Mr. Agent.
      You know perfectly well that people on the main will not hire these men,
      even if they <i>are</i> able-bodied. Everybody is down on them. You said
      that to me last evening. They will be kicked from pillar to post&mdash;from
      this town to that! They will be worse than beggars. And they must drag
      these women and little children about with them. I will expose this
      thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That exposure will sound fine!&rdquo; sneered the commissioner. &ldquo;Exposing a
      state officer for doing what the Governor and Council have ordered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ordered on your advice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it has been ordered! And I'll be backed up! As soon as I can get to
      a justice I shall swear out a warrant against you for interfering with a
      state officer.&rdquo; He flung down the stub of his cigar. &ldquo;Listen, you people!
      Get off this island. Anybody who is here at sunset&mdash;man, woman, or
      child&mdash;will be arrested and put in jail for trespassing on state
      land. Now you'd all better give three cheers for your meddling friend,
      here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have allus let us stay, even when they have threated us before now,&rdquo;
       whimpered a man. &ldquo;He has poured the fat into the fire for us, that's what
      he has done!&rdquo; He pointed his finger at Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's wicked!&rdquo; gasped the girl. &ldquo;These poor folks don't know any better,
      they are not responsible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, look here, you folks!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Speed, who had been holding
      himself in with great difficulty. &ldquo;It's about time for you to wake up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The plutocrat of the house-boat had come up from the beach and had been
      listening. The whimpering man started to speak again, and the magnate of
      the island cuffed him soundly; it was plain that this man, who had lived
      in the best house, had been a personage of authority in the tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm ashamed of the whole caboodle of ye,&rdquo; he vociferated. &ldquo;Here's a gent
      that's been standing up for us. He's the only man I ever heard say a good
      word for us or try to help us! Nobody else in the world ever done it! Take
      off your hats and thank him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm in it!&rdquo; whispered Mayo to the girl. &ldquo;For heaven's sake, what am I
      going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do all you can&mdash;please, Captain Mayo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped forward. The agent began to shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, sir!&rdquo; broke in the captain with quarter-deck air that made for
      obedience and attention. &ldquo;You have had your say! Now I'm going to have
      mine. Listen to me, folks! I'm not the man to get my friends into trouble
      and then run off and leave 'em. All of you who are kicked out by the state&mdash;all
      men, women, and children who are ready to go to work&mdash;come over to me
      on the main at Maquoit with what stuff you can bring in your dories. I'll
      be waiting for you there. My name is Boyd Mayo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll remember that name, myself,&rdquo; declared the angry agent. &ldquo;You'll be
      shown that you can't interfere in a state matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have turned these folks loose in the world, and I'm going to give 'em
      a hand when they come to where I am. If you choose to call that
      interference, come on! It will make a fine story in court!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not stop to shake the grimy hands which were thrust out to him. He
      pushed his way out of the crowd, and his party followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meet me yonder on the main, boys,&rdquo; he called back with a sailor
      heartiness which they understood. &ldquo;We'll see what can be done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what in the infernal blazes can be done?&rdquo; growled Captain Candage,
      catching step with the champion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't do nothing any more sensible with them critters than you could
      with combined cases of the smallpox and the seven years' itch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; cried the girl, reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what I'm talking about! This is dum foolishness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Mayo is a noble man! You ought to be ashamed of hanging back when
      your help is needed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't blame you for sassing that skewangled old tywhoopus, sir,&rdquo;
       admitted the old skipper. &ldquo;I wanted to do it myself. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I don't deserve much praise,&rdquo; said Mayo. &ldquo;I've been getting
      back at that agent. He made me mad. I'm apt to go off half-cocked like
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I, sir&mdash;and I'm always sorry for it. We'd better dig out
      before that tribe of gazaboos lands on our backs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not a bit of it! I have given my word, sir. I must see it through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are you going to do with 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed if I know right now! When I'm good and mad I don't stop to
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I meet 'em for you and tell 'em you have had a sudden death in
      your family and have been called away? They won't know the difference,&rdquo;
       volunteered Captain Candage. &ldquo;And a real death would be lucky for you
      beside of what's in store if you hang around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall hang around, sir. I can't afford to be ashamed of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you have said quite enough, father,&rdquo; stated Polly Candage, with
      vigor.
    </p>
    <p>
      '&ldquo;I have heard of adopting families before,&rdquo; said the irreconcilable one,
      &ldquo;but I never heard of any such wholesale operation as this. I'm thinking
      I'll go climb a tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They embarked in the dory. Mr. Speed and Dolph splashed their oars and
      rowed, exchanging looks and not venturing to offer any comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might auction 'em off to farmers for scarecrows,&rdquo; pursued Captain
      Candage, still worrying the topic as a dog mouths a bone. &ldquo;They ain't fit
      for no more active jobs than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do hope you'll forgive my father for talking this way,&rdquo; pleaded Polly
      Candage. She raised brimming eyes to the sympathetic gaze of the young man
      beside her. &ldquo;He doesn't understand it the way I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I don't exactly understand it myself,&rdquo; he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what you are doing for them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't done anything as yet except start trouble for them. Now I must
      do a little something to square myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a reward for good deeds, Captain Mayo, when you help those who
      cannot help themselves. I believe what the Bible says about casting bread
      on the waters. It will return to you some day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled down on her enthusiasm tolerantly, but he was far from realizing
      then that this pretty girl, whose eyes were so bright behind her tears,
      and whose cheeks were flushed with the ardor of her admiration, was
      speaking to him with the tongue of a sibyl.

     O what is that which smells so tarry?
     I've nothing in the house that's tarry.
     It's a tarry sailor, down below,

    <p>
      Captain Candage growled and complained so persistently during the trip to
      the main that Mayo expected to be deserted by the querulous skipper the
      moment the dory's prow touched the beach. But the skipper came dogging at
      his heels when Mayo set off up the one street of Maquoit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I come along with you?&rdquo; asked the girl at his side. &ldquo;I can see that
      you are thinking up some plan. I do Hope I may come!&rdquo; He gave her his aim
      for answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't been into this port for some time, Captain Candage, but the
      last trip I made here, as I remember, a man named Rowley, who runs the
      general store, was first selectman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is now,&rdquo; grunted the skipper. &ldquo;They've got into the habit of electing him
      and can't seem to break off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they arrived in front of the store Captain Candage took the lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may as well go in and introduce you, whatever it is you want of him. I
      know Rufe Rowley as well as anybody ever gets to know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rowley leaned over his counter and acknowledged the introduction with
      a flicker of amiability lighting his reserve. But his wan smile faded into
      blankness and he clawed his chin beard nervously when Mayo informed him
      that he had invited the evicted folks of Hue and Cry to land on the
      mainland that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As overseer of the poor in this town I can't allow it, Captain Mayo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those people must land somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, of course!&rdquo; admitted Selectman Rowley. &ldquo;But not here! I'm
      beholden to the taxpayers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose the officers of all the other towns about here will say the
      same?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you still own that old fish-house?&rdquo; asked the captain, after
      hesitating for a few moments; &ldquo;the sardine-canning plant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not using it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't paying you any revenue, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you ought to be willing to let it pretty cheap&mdash;month-to-month
      lease!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depends on what I'm letting it for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to stow those poor people in there till I can arrange further for
      them, either show the matter up to the state, or get work for them, or
      something! Will you let me have it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; declared the selectman, with vigor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only monthly lease, I repeat. You can prevent them from getting
      pauper residence here, in case none of my plans work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't want 'em here&mdash;won't have 'em! I consider taxpayers first!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ye ever consider common, ordinary, human decency?&rdquo; roared Captain
      Epps Candage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was astonishing interruption. Its violence made it startling. Mayo
      whirled and stared amazedly at this new recruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage yanked his fat wallet from his pocket and dammed it down
      on the counter with a bang which made the selectman's eyes snap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know <i>me</i>, Rowley! We've got the money to pay for what we order
      and contract for. Them folks ain't paupers so long as we stand be-hind
      'em. We are bringing 'em ashore, here, because it's right to help 'em get
      onto their feet. Hold on, Captain Mayo; you let me talk to Rowley! Him and
      me know how to get sociable in a business talk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, Captain Candage seemed to be seeking sociability by bellowing
      ferociously, thudding his hard fist on the counter. Mayo was not easily
      surprised by the temperamental vagaries of queer old 'longcoast crabs like
      Captain Candage, but this sudden conversion did take away his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a close and partickler friend of mine, like this one I've just
      introduced, comes to you all polite and asks a favor, I want general
      politeness all around or I'll know the reason why,&rdquo; shouted the
      intermediary. &ldquo;Look-a-here, Rowley, you pretend to be a terrible Christian
      sort of a man. When I have been fog-bound here I've tended out on
      prayer-meetings, and I have heard you holler like a good one about dying
      grace and salvation is free. I've never heard you say much about living
      charity that costs something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I claim to be a Christian man,&rdquo; faltered Rowley, backing away from the
      banging fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then act like one. If you don't do it, blast your pelt, I'll post you for
      a heathen from West Quoddy to Kittery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, my dad!&rdquo; whispered the girl, snuggling close to the
      skipper's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Furthermore, Rowley, besides paying you a fair rental for that old
      fish-house we'll buy grub for them poor devils out of your store.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rowley caressed his beard and blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're like empty nail-kags, and they'll eat a lot of vittles and we've
      got the money to pay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a wallet of my own,&rdquo; stated Captain Mayo. He had not recovered
      from his amazement at the sudden shift about of Captain Candage. After all
      the sullen growling he had been tempted to ask the old skipper to stop
      tagging him about on his errand of mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear that, Rowley? This is the best friend I've got in the whole world!
      Brought him in here! Introduced him to you! Here's my daughter!
      Interested, too! Now, whatever you say, you'd better be sure that you pick
      the right words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm always ready to help friends,&rdquo; stated Mr. Rowley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and do business in a slack time,&rdquo; added Captain Candage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm willing to show Christian charity to them that's poor and oppressed.
      But what's the sense in doing it in this case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great many folks in this life need a hard jolt before they turn to and
      make anything of themselves,&rdquo; said Captain Mayo. &ldquo;The people on Hue and
      Cry have had their jolt. I do believe, with the right advice and
      management, they can be made self-supporting. They have been allowed to
      run loose until now, sir. I have been pulled into the thing all of a
      sudden, and now that I'm in I'm willing to give up a little time and
      effort to start 'em off. I haven't much of anything else to do just now,&rdquo;
       he added, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into my back office,&rdquo; invited Mr. Rowley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obleeged&mdash;we'll do so,&rdquo; said Captain Candage. &ldquo;You're a bright
      man, Rowley, and I knowed you'd see the p'int when it was put up to you
      right and polite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The business in the back office was soon settled satisfactorily, and a
      busy day followed on the heels of that momentous morning. When night fell
      the men, women, and children whom a benevolent state&mdash;through its
      &ldquo;straight-business&rdquo; agent&mdash;had turned loose upon the world to shift
      for themselves, were located in a single colony in the spacious
      fish-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few second-hand stoves, hired from Rowley, served to cook the food
      bought from Rowley, and the families grouped themselves in rooms and
      behind partitions and arranged the poor belongings they had salvaged from
      their homes. Even the citizen who had at first resolved to go floating on
      the bosom of the deep joined the colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's more sociable,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;and my wife don't like to give up her
      neighbors. Furthermore, I know the whole bunch, root and branch, whims,
      notions, and all, and they can't fool me. I'll help boss 'em!&rdquo; He became a
      lieutenant of value.
    </p>
    <p>
      This community life under a better roof than had ever sheltered them
      before in their lives seemed to delight the refugees. Old and young, they
      enjoyed the new surroundings with the zest of children. They had never
      taken thought of the morrow in their existence on Hue and Cry. Given food
      and shelter in this new abode, they did not worry about the problems of
      the future. They roamed about their domain with the satisfaction of
      princes in a palace. They did not show any curiosity regarding what was to
      be done with them. They did not ask Captain Mayo and his associates any
      questions. They surveyed him with a dumb and sort of canine thankfulness
      when he moved among them. He himself tried questions on a few of the more
      intelligent men, hoping that they would show some initiative. They told
      him with bland serenity that they would leave it all to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are you going to do for yourselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what you say. You're the boss. Show us the job!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was borne in upon him that he had taken a larger contract than he had
      planned on. Rowley and the taxpayers on the main looked to him on one
      side, and his dependents on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to be up to me&mdash;to us, I mean,&rdquo; he told the girl, ruefully,
      when they were on their way to the widow's cottage that evening. &ldquo;It's up
      to me most of all, however, for I'm the guilty party&mdash;I have pulled
      you and your father in. I'm pegged in here till I can think up some sort
      of a scheme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had been working all day faithfully by his side, a tactful and
      indefatigable helper. He would have been all at sea regarding the women
      and children without her aid, and he told her so gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both my hands and my heart are with you in this thing, Captain Mayo. And
      I know you'll think of some way out for them&mdash;just as you helped us
      out of the schooner after we had given up all hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Getting out of the schooner was merely a sailor's trick of the hands,
      Miss Candage. I don't believe I'll be much of a hand at making over human
      nature. I have too much of it myself, and the material down in that
      fish-house would puzzle even a doctor of divinity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you will think of some plan,&rdquo; she assured him-with fine loyalty. &ldquo;If
      you will allow me to help in my poor way I'll be proud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll not tell you what I think of your help; it might sound like soft
      talk. But let me tell you that you have one grand old dad!&rdquo; he declared,
      earnestly; but although he tried to keep his face straight and his tones
      steady he looked down at her and immediately lost control of himself.
      Merriment was mingled with tears in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't he funny?&rdquo; she gasped, and they halted in their tracks and laughed
      in chorus with the whole-hearted fervor of youth; that laughter relieved
      the strain of that anxious day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not laughing <i>at</i> your father&mdash;you understand that!&rdquo; he
      assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, you are not! I know. But you are getting to understand him,
      just as I understand him. He is only a big child under all his bluster.
      But he does make me so angry sometimes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't tell much about a Yankee till he comes out of his shell, and I
      agree with you as to the aggravating qualities in Captain Candage. I'm not
      very patient myself, when I'm provoked! But after this he and I will get
      along all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked on to the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; he said at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have no plan as yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe something will come to me in a dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dream did not come to him, for his sleep was the profound slumber of
      exhaustion. He went down in the early dawn and plunged into the sea, and
      while he was walking back toward the cottage an idea and a conviction
      presented themselves, hand in hand. The conviction had been with him
      before&mdash;that he could not back out just then and leave those poor
      people to shift for themselves, as anxious as he was to be off about his
      own affairs; his undertaking was quixotic, but if he abandoned it at that
      juncture a queer story would chase him alongcoast, and he knew what sort
      of esteem mariners entertained for quitters.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, deep in his heart, he confessed that it was not merely sailor
      pride that spurred him. The pathetic helplessness of the tribe of Hue and
      Cry appealed with an insistence he could not deny. He understood them as
      he understood similar colonies along the coast&mdash;children whom an
      indifferent world classed as man and treated with thoughtless injustice!
      Work was prescribed for them, as for others! But, they did not know how to
      work or how to make their work pay them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea which came to him with the conviction that he must help these
      folks concerned work for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast he took Captain Candage into his confidence, much to the
      skipper's bland delight at being considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it's something where we can fetch Rowley in,&rdquo; confessed the
      skipper. &ldquo;I don't care anything for them critters,&rdquo; he added, assuming
      brusqueness. &ldquo;Don't want it hinted around that I'm getting simple in my
      old age. But they give me an excuse to bingdoodle Rowley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To carry out that plan I have outlined we need some kind of a packet,&rdquo;
       said Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! We'll go right to Rowley. He'll know. If there's anything in this
      section that he 'ain't got his finger on some way&mdash;bill of sale,
      mortgage, debt owed to him or expecting to be owed, then it ain't worth
      noticing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rowley listened in his back office. He stroked his beard contentedly
      and beamed his pleasure when he saw the prospect of making another
      profitable dicker with men who seemed to be reliable and energetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a mortgage on the <i>Ethel and May</i> when Captain Tebbets passed
      on to the higher life,&rdquo; he informed them. &ldquo;Widder gave up the schooner
      when I foreclosed, she not desiring to&mdash;er&mdash;bother with vessel
      proputty. So I have it free and clear without it standing me such a
      terrible sum! Shall be pleased to charter to you gents at a reasonable
      figure. Furthermore, seeing that industry makes for righteousness, so we
      are told, your plan of making those critters go to work may be a good one,
      providing you'll use a club on 'em often enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what I've heard of your talk in prayer-meeting I should think you'd
      advise moral suasion,&rdquo; suggested Captain Candage, plainly relishing this
      opportunity to &ldquo;bingdoodle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I use common sense, whether it's in religion or politics or business,&rdquo;
       snapped Rowley, exhibiting a bit of un-Christian heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's advisable to ile up common sense with a little charity, and then the
      machine won't squeak so bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't undertake to trot a dogfish on my knee or sing him to sleep
      with a pennyr'yal hymn, Captain Candage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we can show results without the club,&rdquo; interposed Mayo, with mild
      intent to smooth the tone of this repartee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk called Mr. Rowley out into the store on some matter of special
      importance, and the selectman departed, coming down rather hard on his
      heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old Adam sort of torches up through his shell once in a while,&rdquo;
       commented Candage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'd better settle the charter price, sir, before you lay aboard him too
      much,&rdquo; advised the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just natch'ally can't help harpooning him,&rdquo; confessed the skipper.
      &ldquo;He's a darned old hypocrite, cheating widders and orphans by choice
      because they 'ain't got the spunk to razoo back, and I've allus enjoyed
      fighting such as him. Him and me is due for a row. But I'll hold off the
      best I can till we have got him beat down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo's plan involved the modest venture of chartering a craft suitable for
      fishing. There was no material for real Banksmen in the Hue and Cry
      colony, but the run of the men would serve to go trawling for ground and
      shack fish a few miles off the coast. It was the only scheme which would
      afford employment for the whole body of dependents; older and more
      decrepit men and the women and children could dig and shuck clams for the
      trawl bait. In order to encourage ambition and independence among the
      abler men of the colony, Mayo suggested that the fishermen be taken on
      shares, and Captain Candage agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Rowley came back into the office he found his match waiting for
      him in the person of Captain Candage, primed and ready to drive a sharp
      bargain. At the end of an hour papers representing the charter of the <i>Ethel
      and May</i> were turned over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon it's a good job,&rdquo; affirmed the skipper, when he and Mayo were
      outside the Rowley store. &ldquo;I have made up my mind to let poor old <i>Polly</i>
      go to Davy Jones's locker. I wrote to the shippers and the consignees of
      the lumber last night. If they want it they can go after it. I may as well
      fish for the rest of this season!&rdquo; He regarded Captain Mayo with eyes in
      which query was almost wistftul. &ldquo;Of course, you can depend on me to see
      to it that you get your share, sir, just as if you were aboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going aboard, Captain Candage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man stopped stock still and stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't anything in sight just now. You need help in getting the thing
      started right. I'm not going away and leave that gang on your hands until
      I can see how the plan works out. I'll go as mate with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by a blame sight you won't go as no mate with me,&rdquo; objected Candage.
      &ldquo;You'll go as skipper and I'll be proud to take orders from you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were wrangling amiably on that point when they returned to the
      widow's cottage. Polly Candage broke the deadlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not have two captains? That will be something brand new along the
      coast!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rest of it is brand new enough without that,&rdquo; blurted her father.
      &ldquo;But considering what kind of a crew we've got I guess two captains ain't
      any too much! I'll be captain number two and I know enough to keep my
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think you and I will ever do much quarreling again!&rdquo; smiled
      Captain Mayo, extending his hand and receiving Candage's mighty grip. &ldquo;I
      am going to start out a few letters, and I'll go now and write them. Until
      those letters bring me something in the way of a job I am with you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage walked down toward the fish-house with his daughter.
      &ldquo;Polly,&rdquo; he declared, after an embarrassed silence, &ldquo;I have been all wrong
      in your case, girl. Here and now I give you clearance papers. Sail for
      home just as soon as you want to. I'm asking no questions! It's none of my
      business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My little affairs must always be business of yours, father,&rdquo; she
      returned.. &ldquo;I love you. I will obey you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I ain't giving off no more orders. I ain't fit to command in the
      waters where you are sailing, Polly dear. So run along home and be my good
      girl! I know you will be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have changed my mind about going home&mdash;just now!&rdquo; Her eyes met his
      frankly. &ldquo;I have written to Aunt Zilpah to send me some of my clothes.
      Father,&rdquo; there was feminine, rather indignant amazement in her tones, &ldquo;do
      you know that there isn't a single woman from Hue and Cry who knows how to
      use a needle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have guessed it, judging from the way their young ones and men
      folk go looking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you realize that those children don't even know their A-B-C's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard of any college perfessers being raised on that island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to take a vacation from the millinery-shop, now that I am down
      here. I'll show those women how to sew and cook, and I'll teach those
      children how to read. It's only right&mdash;my duty! I couldn't go home
      and be happy without doing it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calling that a vacation is putting a polite name to it, Polly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could have seen their eyes, father, when I promised to help them,
      you wouldn't wonder why I am staying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't wonder, Polly, my girl! If you had gone away and&mdash;and left
      us&mdash;Mayo and me&mdash;I should have been mighty disappointed in ye!
      But I really never thought much about your going&mdash;'cause you wouldn't
      go, I knew, till you had helped all you could.&rdquo; He put his arm around her.
      &ldquo;I have been worrying about having brought you away. But I guess God had
      it all figgered out for us. I didn't know my own girl the way I ought to
      have knowed her. I'd been away too much. But now we're sort of growing up&mdash;together&mdash;sort
      of that, ain't we, Polly dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her arms about his neck and answered him with a kiss.

      XIV ~ BEARINGS FOR A NEW COURSE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     And now, my brave boys, comes the best of the fun,
     It's hands about ship and reef topsails in one;
     So it's lay aloft, topman, as the hellum goes down,
     And clew down your topsails as the mainyard goes round.
                                   &mdash;La Pique.
</pre>
    <p>
      At the end of that week the <i>Ethel and May</i> had delivered at market
      her first fare of fish and her captains had divided her first shares. Mayo
      decided that the results were but of proportion to the modest returns. He
      was viewing the regeneration of the tribe of Hue and Cry. In their case it
      had been the right touch at the right time. For years their hopes had been
      hungry for a chance to make good. Now gratitude inspired them and an
      almost insane desire to show that they were not worthless drove them to
      supreme effort. The leaven of the psychology of independence was getting
      in its work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people of Hue and Cry for three generations had been made to feel that
      they were pariahs. When they had brought their fish or clams to the
      mainland the buyers were both unjust and contemptuous, as if they were
      dealing with begging children who must expect only a charitable gift for
      their product instead of a real man's price. Prices suited the
      fish-buyers' moods of the day. The islanders had never been admitted to
      the plane of straight business like other fishermen. They had always taken
      meekly what had been offered&mdash;whether coin or insults. Therefore,
      their labor had never returned them full values.
    </p>
    <p>
      They who bought made the poor wretches feel that it constituted a special
      favor to take their fish at any price.
    </p>
    <p>
      They seemed to come into their own that first day at market when the <i>Ethel
      and May</i> made her bigness in the dock at the city fish-house. Masterful
      men represented them in the dealings with the buyers. The crew hid their
      delighted grins behind rough palms when Captain Epps Candage bawled out
      bidders who were under market quotations; they gazed with awe on Captain
      Mayo when he read from printed sheets&mdash;print being a mystery they had
      never mastered&mdash;and figured with ready pencil and even corrected the
      buyer, who acknowledged his error and humbly apologized. No more
      subservient paltering at the doors of fish-houses!
    </p>
    <p>
      Back home the women and the children and the old folks had a good roof
      over their heads; the fishers had the deck of a tidy schooner under their
      feet. Shiftlessness departed from them. After years of oppression they had
      found their opportunity. More experienced men would have found this new
      fortune only modest; these men grasped it with juvenile enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were over the side of the schooner and out in their dories when more
      cautious trawlsmen hugged the fo'c'sle. On their third trip, because of
      this daring, they caught the city market bare on a Thursday and made a
      clean-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm told that Saint Peter started this Friday notion because he was in
      the fish business,&rdquo; stated Captain Candage, sorting money for the shares.
      &ldquo;All I've got to say is, he done a good job of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Speed, sailing as mate, always found ready obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smut-nosed Dolph never listened before to such praise as was lavished by
      the hungry men over the pannikins which he heaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo, casting up accounts one day, was honestly astonished to find
      that almost a month had passed since he had landed at Maquoit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That goes to show how a man will get interested when he is picked up and
      tossed into a thing,&rdquo; he said to Polly Candage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are making real men of them, Captain Mayo!&rdquo; She added, with a laugh,
      &ldquo;And you told me you were no kind of a hand at making over human nature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are doing it themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say nothing to wound your modesty, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I must wake up. I must! There's nothing worth while in the profit for
      both your father and myself. I want him to have the proposition alone.
      There'll be a fair make for him. I didn't intend to stay here so long. I
      guess I sort of forgot myself.&rdquo; He went on with his figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I knew you could not forget,&rdquo; she ventured, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced up and found a queer expression on her countenance. There were
      frank sympathy and friendliness in her eyes. He had revolved bitter
      thoughts alone, struggling with a problem he could not master. In sudden
      emotion&mdash;in an unpremeditated letting-go of himself&mdash;he reached
      out for somebody in whom to confide. He needed counsel in a matter where
      no man could help him. This girl was the only one who could understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There may be letters waiting for me in the city&mdash;in the big city
      where I may be expected,&rdquo; he blurted. &ldquo;I haven't dared to send any.&rdquo; He
      hesitated, and then gave way to his impulse. &ldquo;Miss Polly, I haven't any
      right to trouble you with my affairs. I may seem impertinent. But you are
      a girl! Does a girl usually sit down and think over all the difficulties&mdash;when
      she doesn't get letters&mdash;and then make allowances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure she does&mdash;when she loves anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet it may seem very strange. I am worried out of my senses. I don't
      know what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a long time, looking away from him and twisting her
      hands in her lap; she was plainly searching her soul for inspiration&mdash;and
      courage!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think she will understand the situation?&rdquo; he insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ought to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no word from me! Silence for weeks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was low, but she evidently had found courage. &ldquo;I have not heard
      one word&mdash;not a letter has come to me&mdash;since I left my aunt's
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you feel sure that he loves you just the same? You don't need
      letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! I don't need letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in my case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could see that she loves you very much. She stood out before them all,
      Captain Mayo. That sort of a girl does not need letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have put new courage in me. I believe you understand just how a girl
      would feel. You know a Yankee! He expects to find a friend just where he
      left him, in the matter of affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A girl does not need to be a Yankee to be that way in her love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't sneak around to her by the back way&mdash;I can't do that!&rdquo; he
      cried. &ldquo;I don't want to be ashamed of myself. I don't want to bring more
      trouble to her. Don't you think she will wait for me until I can come&mdash;and
      come right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will wait for you, sir. It's the nature of women to wait&mdash;when
      they love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I cannot ask her to wait forever. That's why I must go away and try
      to make good.&rdquo; He set his teeth, and his jaw muscles were ridged. &ldquo;I
      believe a man can get what he goes after in the right spirit, Miss Polly.&rdquo;
       He swing off the porch and left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fog was heavy on shore and sea that day, holding the <i>Ethel and May</i>
      in port. He disappeared into the stifling mist, and the girl sat and
      stared into that vacancy for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo rowed out to the schooner, which was anchored in the harbor roads. He
      was carrying his accounts to Captain Candage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing and facing forward as he rowed, he came suddenly upon a big
      steam-yacht which had stolen into the cove through the fog and was
      anchored in his course. She was the <i>Sprite</i>, and he had formed a
      'longshore acquaintance with her skipper that summer, meeting him in
      harbors where the <i>Sprite</i> and <i>Olenia</i> had been neighbors in
      the anchorage. He stopped rowing and allowed the dory to drift. He noted
      that the blue flag was flying at the main starboard spreader, announcing
      the absence of the owner, and he understood that he could call for the
      skipper without embarrassing that gentleman. One of the crew was putting
      covers on the brasswork forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compliments to Captain Trott, and tell him that Captain Mayo is at the
      gangway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The skipper appeared promptly, replying to the hail before the sailor had
      stirred. &ldquo;Come aboard, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll not bother you that much, captain. I can ask my question just as
      well from here. Do you know of any good opening for a man of my size?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain of the <i>Sprite</i> came to the rail and did not reply
      promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have left the <i>Olenia</i> and I'm looking for something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Trott started for the gangway. &ldquo;Oh, you needn't trouble to come
      down, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd rather, Captain Mayo.&rdquo; After he had descended he squatted on the
      platform at the foot of the ladder and held the dory close, grasping the
      gunwale. &ldquo;What are you doing for yourself these days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo had no relish for a long story. &ldquo;I'm waiting to grab in on
      something,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Trott did not show any alacrity in getting to the subject which
      Mayo had broached. &ldquo;It has set in pretty thick, hasn't it? I have been
      ordered in here to wait for my folks; they're visiting at some big estate
      up-river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But about the chance for a job, captain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here! What kind of a run-in did you have with the <i>Olenia</i>
      owner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo opened his mouth and then promptly closed it. He could not reveal the
      nature of the trouble between himself and his former employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had words,&rdquo; he said, stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I reckon so! But the rest of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't tell me any more than you feel like doing, of course,&rdquo; said
      Captain Trott. &ldquo;But I have to tell <i>you</i> that Mr. Marston has come
      out with some pretty fierce talk for an owner to make. He has made quite a
      business of circulating that talk. I didn't realize that you are of so
      much importance in the world, Mayo,&rdquo; he added, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what he is saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you leave him in the night&mdash;without notice, or something of
      the kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you have a good story to back you up, Captain Mayo, for I have
      liked you mighty well ever since meeting you first. What is behind it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can tell somebody&mdash;somebody who can straighten the thing out
      for you, can't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Captain Trott.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know what has happened in your case, don't you?&rdquo; The skipper of
      the <i>Sprite</i> exhibited a little testiness at being barred out of
      Mayo's confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marston claims that you mutinied and deserted him&mdash;slipped away in
      the night&mdash;threw up your job on the high seas&mdash;left him to work
      to New York with a short crew&mdash;the mate as captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's an infernal lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then come forward and show him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot talk about the case. I have my reasons&mdash;good ones!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry for you, Mayo. You are done in the yachting game, I'm afraid.
      He'll blacklist you in every yacht club from Bar Harbor to Miami. I have
      heard my folks talking about it. He seems to have a terrible grudge&mdash;more
      than a big man usually bothers about in the case of a skipper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo set his oar against the edge of the platform and pushed off. The
      skipper called after him, but he was instantly swallowed up by the fog and
      did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      On board the <i>Ethel and May</i> his ragged but cheery crew were baiting
      up, hooking clams upon the ganging hooks, and coiling lines into tubs. The
      men grinned greeting when he swung over the rail. He scowled at them; he
      even turned a glowering look on Captain Candage when he met the latter on
      the quarter-deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir! I see how it is! You're getting cussed sick of this two-cent
      game here,&rdquo; said Candage, mournfully. &ldquo;I don't blame ye. We ain't in your
      class, here, Captain Mayo.&rdquo; He took the papers which the young man held
      out to him. &ldquo;I suppose this is the last time we'll share, you and me. I'll
      miss ye devilish bad. I'd rather go for nothing and let you have it all
      than lose ye. But, of course, it ain't no use to argue or coax.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo went and sat on the rail, folding his arms, and did not reply. The
      old skipper trudged forward, his head bowed, his hands clutched behind his
      back. When he returned Mayo stood up and put his hand on the old man's
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Candage, please don't misunderstand me. Just at present I feel
      that the only friends I have in the world are here. Don't mind the way I
      acted just now when I came on board. I have had a lot of trouble&mdash;I'm
      having more of it. I'm not going to leave you just yet. I want to stay
      aboard until I can think it all over&mdash;can get my grip. That is, if
      you're satisfied to have it that way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satisfied! Jumping Cicero!&rdquo; exploded Captain Can-dage. He took the dory
      and rowed ashore. He found his daughter gazing into the fog from the porch
      of the widow's cottage. &ldquo;He is going to stay a while longer,&rdquo; he informed
      her, rapturously. &ldquo;Something has happened. Do you suppose that girl has
      throwed him over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, do you dare to chuckle because a friend is in trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll laugh and slap my leg if he ever gets shet of that hity-tity girl,&rdquo;
       he rejoined, stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am astonished&mdash;I am ashamed of you, father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Polly dear, be honest with your dad!&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Do you want to see him
      married off to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly do. I only wish I might help him.&rdquo; Her lips were white, her
      voice trembled. She got up and hurried into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be cussed if I understand wimmen,&rdquo; declared Captain Candage,
      fiddling his finger under his nose. &ldquo;That feller she has picked out for
      herself must be the Emp'ror of Peeroo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo did not come ashore again before the <i>Ethel and May</i>
      sailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fog cleared that night and they smashed out to the fishing-grounds
      ahead of a cracking breeze, and had their trawls down in the early dawn.
      At sundown, trailed by a wavering banner of screaming gulls who gobbled
      the &ldquo;orts&rdquo; tossed over by the busy crew cleaning their catch, they were
      docking at the city fish-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky again,&rdquo; commented Captain Candage, returning from his sharp dicker
      with the buyer. &ldquo;The city critters are all hungry for haddock, and that's
      just what we hit to-day.&rdquo; He surveyed his gloomy partner with sympathetic
      concern. &ldquo;Why don't you take a run uptown?&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;You're sticking
      too close to this packet for a young man. Furthermore, if you see a store
      open buy me a box of paper collars. Rowley hain't got my size!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo, unreconciled and uneasy, hating that day the sound of the flapping,
      sliding fish as they were pitchforked into the tubs for hoisting, annoyed
      by the yawling of pulleys and realizing that his nerves were not right at
      all, obeyed the suggestion. He had a secret errand of his own, yielding to
      a half-hope; he went to the general-delivery window of the post-office and
      asked for mail. He knew that love makes keen guesses. The <i>Olenia</i>
      had visited that harbor frequently for mail. But there was nothing for
      him. He strolled about the streets, nursing his melancholy, forgetting
      Captain Candage's commission, envying the contentment shown by others.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that mood he would have avoided Captain Zoradus Wass if he had spied
      that boisterously cheerful mariner in season. But the captain had him by
      the arm and was dancing him about the sidewalk, showing more affability
      than was his wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heifers o' Herod! youngster,&rdquo; shouted the grizzled master, &ldquo;have you come
      looking for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; faltered Mayo. &ldquo;Did you want to see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have worn taps off my boots to-day chasing from shipping commissioner's
      office to every hole and corner along the water-front. Heard you had quit
      aboard a yacht, and reckoned you had got sensible again and wanted real
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had asked down among the fish-houses you might have got on track
      of me, sir.&rdquo; Mayo's tone was somber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fish! You fishing?&rdquo; demanded Captain Wass, with incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and on a chartered smack at that&mdash;shack-fishing on shares!&rdquo;
       Mayo was sourly resolved to paint his low estate in black colors. &ldquo;And I
      have concluded it's about all I'm fit for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's fine, seaman-like talk to come from a young chap I have trained up
      to master's papers, giving him two years in my pilot-house. I was afraid
      you were going astern, you young cuss, when I heard you'd gone skipper of
      a yacht, but I didn't think it was as bad as all this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My yachting business is done, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank the bald-headed Nicodemus! There's hopes of you. Did anybody tell
      you I've been looking for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad of it. Now I can tell you myself. Do you know where I am now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you were on a Vose line freighter, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know who told you that&mdash;but it wasn't Ananias. You're right.
      She's the old <i>Nequasset</i>, handed back to me again because I'm the
      only one who understands her cussed fool notions. First mate got drunk
      yesterday and broke second mate's leg in the scuffle&mdash;one is in jail
      and t'other in the hospital, and never neither of 'em will step aboard any
      ship with me again. I sail at daybreak, bade to the Chesapeake for steel
      rails. Got your papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along. You're first mate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really want me, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want you? Confound it all, I've got you! In about half a day I'll have
      all the yacht notions shaken out of you and the fish-scales stripped off,
      and then you'll be what you was when I let you go&mdash;the smartest
      youngster I ever trained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo obeyed the thrust of the jubilant master's arm and went along. &ldquo;I'll
      go and explain to Captain Can-dage, my partner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I'll go along, too, and help you make it short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they walked along Captain Wass inspected his companion critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High living aboard Marston's yacht make you dyspeptic, son? You look as
      if your vittles hadn't been agreeing with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My health is all right, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard you had trouble with Marston,&rdquo; proceeded the old skipper, with
      brutal frankness. &ldquo;Anybody who has trouble with that damnation pirate
      comes well recommended to me. He is trying to steal every steamboat line
      on this coast. Thank Gawd, he can never get his claws on the old Vose
      line. Some great doings in the steamboat business are ahead, Mayo. Reckon
      it's a good line to be in if you like fight and want to make your
      bigness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo walked on in silence. He was troubled by this added information that
      news of his affair with Marston had gained such wide currency. However, he
      was glad that this new opportunity offered him a chance to hide himself in
      the isolation of a freighter's pilot-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage received the news with meek resignation. &ldquo;I knowed it
      would have to come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Couldn't expect much else. Howsomever, it
      ain't comforting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't keep a good boy like this pawing around in fish gurry,&rdquo; stated
      Captain Wass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, and I wish him well and all the best!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their leave-taking, presided over by the peremptory master of the <i>Nequasset</i>,
      was short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll probably have a chance to see you when we come here again,&rdquo; called
      Mayo from the wharf, looking down into the mournful countenance of the
      skipper. &ldquo;Perhaps I'll have time to run down to Maquoit while we are
      discharging. At any rate, explain it all for me, especially to your
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell all concerned just what's right,&rdquo; Captain Candage assured him.
      &ldquo;I'll tell her for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was on the beach when the skipper came rowing in alone from the <i>Ethel
      and May</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone,&rdquo; he called to her. &ldquo;Of course we couldn't keep him. He's too
      smart to stay on a job like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they were on their way up to the widow's cottage he stole
      side-glances at her, and her silence distressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's see! He says to me&mdash;if I can remember it right-he says, says
      he, 'Take my best respects and '&mdash;let's see&mdash;yes, 'take my best
      respects and love to your Polly&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father! Please don't fib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's just as I remember it, dear. 'Especial,' he says. I remember that!
      'Especial,' he says. And he looked mighty sad, dear, mighty sad.&rdquo; He put
      his arm about her. &ldquo;There are a lot of sad things in this world for
      everybody, Polly. Sometimes things get so blamed mixed up that I feel like
      going off and climbing a tree!&rdquo;

      XV ~ THE RULES Of THE ROAD
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Now the <i>Dreadnought's</i> a-sailing the Atlantic so wide,
     Where the high, roaring seas roll along her black side.
     Her sailors like lions walk the deck to and fro,
     She's the Liverpool packet&mdash;O Lord let her go!
                            &mdash;Song of the Flash Packet.
</pre>
    <p>
      On a day in early August the <i>Nequasset</i> came walloping laboriously
      up-coast through a dungeon fog, steel rails her dragging burden, caution
      her watchword.
    </p>
    <p>
      The needle of her indicator marked &ldquo;Half speed,&rdquo; and it really meant half
      speed. Captain Zoradus Wass made scripture of the rules laid down by the
      Department of Commerce and Labor. There was no tricky slipping-over under
      his sway&mdash;no finger-at-nose connivance between the pilot-house and
      the chief engineer's grille platform. No, Captain Wass was not that kind
      of a man, though the fog had held in front of him two days, vapor thick as
      feathers in a tick, and he had averaged not much over six nautical miles
      an hour, and was bitterly aware that the rate of freight on steel rails
      was sixty-five cents a ton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as I've been telling you, at sixty-five cents there's about as much
      profit as there would be in swapping hard dollars from one hand to the
      other and depending on what silver you can rub off,&rdquo; said Captain Wass to
      First-mate Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain was holding the knob of the whistle-pull In constant clutch.
      Regularly every minute <i>Nequasset's</i> prolonged blast sounded,
      strictly according to the rules of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice started with a complaining squawk, was full toned for a few
      moments, then trailed off into more querulousness; the timbre of that tone
      seemed to fit with Captain Wass's mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's tough times when a cargo-carrier has to figger so fine that she can
      lose profit on account of what the men eat,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;If you're two
      days late, minding rules in a fog, owners ask what the tophet's the matter
      with you! This kind of business don't need steamboat men any longer; it
      calls for boarding-house keepers who can cut sirloin steak off'n a critter
      clear to the horn, and who are handy in turning sharp corners on
      left-overs. I'll buy a book of cooking receets and try to turn in
      dividends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain was broad-bowed, like the <i>Nequasset</i>, he sagged on short
      legs as if he carried a cargo fully as heavy as steel rails, his white
      whiskers streamed away from his cutwater nose like the froth kicked up by
      the old freighter's forefoot. He chewed slowly, conscientiously and
      continuously on tobacco which bulged in his cheek; his jaws, moving as
      steadily as a pendulum swings, seemed to set the time for the isochronal
      whistle-blast. Sixty ruminating jaw-wags, then he spat into the fog, then
      the blast&mdash;correct to the clock's tide!
    </p>
    <p>
      The windows of the pilot-house were dropped into their casings, so that
      all sounds might be admitted; the wet breeze beaded the skipper's whiskers
      and dampened the mate's crisp hair. While the mate leaned from a window,
      ear cocked for signals, the captain gave him more of the critical
      inspection in which he had been indulging when occasion served.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, Captain Wass went on pecking around the edges of a topic
      which he had been attacking from time to time with clumsy attempt at
      artful inquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As bad as it is on a freighter, I reckon you ain't sorry you're off that
      yacht, son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not sorry, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what you told me, the owner was around meddling all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't remember that I ever said so, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I thought you did,&rdquo; grunted Captain Wass, and he covered his
      momentary check by sounding the whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that you are back in the steamboat business, of course you're a
      steamboat man. Have the interests of your owners at heart,&rdquo; he resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a lot of help to the regular steamboat men&mdash;the good old
      stand-bys&mdash;if they could get some kind of a line on what them Wall
      Street cusses are gunning through with Marston leading 'em&mdash;or, at
      leastways, he's supposed to be leading. He hides away in the middle of the
      web and lets the other spiders run and fetch. But it's Marston's scheme,
      you can bet on that! What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't thought anything about it, Captain Wass.&rdquo; &ldquo;But how could you
      help thinking, catching a word here and a word there, aboard that yacht?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never listened&mdash;I never heard anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he had them other spiders aboard&mdash;seen 'em myself through my
      spy-glass when you passed us one day in June.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they talked together aft, but my duty was forward, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too bad you didn't have a flea put into your ear about getting a
      line on Marston's scheme, whatever it is. You could have helped the real
      boys in this game!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Wass showed a resolve to quit pecking at the edges and make a dab
      at the center of the subject. He pulled the whistle, released the knob,
      and turned back to the window, setting his elbows on the casing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Son, you ain't in love with that pirate Marston, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; replied the young man, with bitterness that could not be
      doubted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how about your being in love with his daughter?&rdquo; The caustic humor
      in the old skipper's tones robbed the question of some of its brutal
      bluntness, and Mayo was accustomed to Captain Wass's brand of humor. The
      young man did not turn his head for a few moments; he continued to look
      into the fog as if intent on his duty; he was trying to get command of
      himself, fully aware that resentment would not work in the case of Zoradus
      Wass. When Mayo did face the skipper, the latter was discomposed in his
      turn, for Mayo showed his even teeth in a cordial smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I have been trying the chauffeur trick in order to catch an
      heiress, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's quite a gab-wireless operating along-coast and sailors
      don't always keep their yawp closed after they have taken a man's money to
      keep still,&rdquo; stated Captain Wass, pointedly. &ldquo;I wouldn't blame you for
      grabbing in. You're good-looking enough to do what others have done in
      like cases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir. What's the rest of the joke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never joke,&rdquo; retorted the skipper, turning and pulling the
      whistle-cord. <i>Nequasset's</i> squall rose and died down in her brazen
      throat. &ldquo;Her name is Alma?&rdquo; he prodded. &ldquo;Something of a clipper. If
      Marston ever makes you general manager, put me into a better job than
      this, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The skipper gave his mate a disgusted stare. &ldquo;You're a devil of a man to
      keep up a conversation with!&rdquo; He spat against the wall of the fog and
      again let loose the freighter's hoarse lament.
    </p>
    <p>
      From somewhere, ahead, a horn wailed, dividing its call into two blasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Port tack and headed acrost us,&rdquo; snarled the master, after a sniff at the
      air and a squint at the sluggish ripple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why ain't the infernal fool anchored, instead of drifting around
      underfoot? How does he bear, Mr. Mayo?&rdquo; He was now back to pilot-house
      formality with his mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two points and a half, starboard bow, sir. And there's another chap
      giving one horn in about the same direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another drifter&mdash;not wind enough for 'em to know what tack they're
      really on. Well, there's always Article Twenty-seven to fall back on,&rdquo;
       grumbled the skipper. He quoted sarcastically in the tone in which that
      rule is mouthed so often in pilot-houses along coast: '&ldquo;Due regard shall
      be had to all dangers of navigation and collision, and to any special
      circumstances which may render a departure from the above rules necessary,
      and so forth and et cetry. Meaning, thank the Lord, that a steamer can
      always run away from a gad-slammed schooner, even at half speed. Hope if
      it ever comes to a showdown the secretary of the bureau of commerce will
      agree with me. Ease her off to starboard, Mr. Mayo, till we bring 'em
      abeam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate gave a quick glance at the compass. &ldquo;East by nothe, Jack,&rdquo; he
      commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;East by nothe, sir,&rdquo; repeated the quartermaster in mechanical tones,
      spinning the big wheel to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that the <i>Nequasset</i> had considerable company on the
      sea that day. A little abaft her beam a tugboat was blowing one long and
      two short, indicating her tow. She had been their &ldquo;chum&rdquo; for some time,
      and Mayo had occasionally taken her bearings by sound and compass and knew
      that the freighter was slowly forging ahead. He figured, listening again
      to the horns, that the Nequasset was headed to clear all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take a skipper who studies his book and is always ready to look the
      department in the eye, without flinching, he has to mind his own business
      and mind the other fellow's, too,&rdquo; said Captain Wass, continuing his
      monologue of grouch. &ldquo;Dodging here and there, keeping out of the way, two
      days behind schedule, meat three times a day or else you can't keep a
      crew, and everybody hearty at meal-time! My owners have never told me to
      let the law go to hoot and ram her for all she's worth! But when I carry
      in my accounts they seem to be trying to think up language that tells a
      man to do a thing, and yet doesn't tell him. What's that?&rdquo; He put his head
      far out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Floating out of the fog came a dull, grunting sound, a faint and far-away
      diapason, a marine whistle which announced a big chap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say it is a Union liner, sir&mdash;either the <i>Triton</i> or
      <i>Neptune</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They listened. They waited two long minutes for another signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to be taking up his full, legal time,&rdquo; growled Captain Wass. &ldquo;Since
      Marston has gobbled that line maybe he has put on a special register to
      keep tabs on tooting&mdash;thinks it's waste of steam and will reduce
      dividends. Expects us little fellows to do the squawking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The big whistle boomed again, dead ahead, and so much nearer that it
      provoked the skipper to lash out a round oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is reeling off eighteen knots for a gait, or you can use my head for a
      rivet nut!&rdquo; He yanked the cord and the freighter howled angrily. The other
      replied with bellowing roar&mdash;autocratic, domineering. With irony,
      with vindictiveness, Captain Wass pitched his voice in sarcastic nasal
      tone and recited another rule&mdash;thereby trying to express his irate
      opinion of the lawlessness of other men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Article Sixteen, Mr. Mayo! He probably carries it in his watch-case
      instead of his girl's picture! Nice reading for a rainy day! 'A
      steam-vessel hearing apparently forward of her beam the fog signal of a
      vessel, the position of which is not ascertained, shall, so far as the
      circumstances of the case permit, stop her engines and then navigate with
      caution until all danger of collision is over.' Hooray for the rules!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Wass hooked a gnarled finger into the loop of the bell-pull and
      yanked upward viciously. A dull clang sounded far below. He pulled again
      and the vibration of the engine ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad rabbit it! I'll go the whole hog as the department orders! If he
      bangs into me we'll see who comes off best at the hearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave the bell-loop two quick jerks; then he shifted his hand to another
      pull and the jingle bell sounded in the engine-room&mdash;the <i>Nequasset</i>
      was ordered to make full speed astern.
    </p>
    <p>
      The freighter shook and shivered when the screw began to reverse, pulling
      at the frothing sea, clawing frantically to haul her to a stop. The
      skipper then gave three resentful, protesting whistle-blasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the reply he received from ahead was a hoarse, prolonged howl. In it
      there was no hint that the big fellow proposed to heed the protest of the
      three blasts. It was insistence on right of way, the insolence of the
      swaggering express liner making time in competition with rivals; it hinted
      confident opinion that smaller chaps would better get out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The on-comer had received a signal which served to justify that opinion.
      Captain Wass had docilely announced that he was going full speed astern,
      his whistle-blasts had declared that he had stepped off the sidewalk of
      the ocean lane&mdash;as usual! The big fellows knew that the little chaps
      would do it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mate Mayo leaned from the window, his jaw muscles tense, anxiety in his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big whistle now was fairly shaking the curtains of the mists and was
      not giving him any comforting assurance that the liner was swinging to
      avoid them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quartermaster was taking the situation more philosophically than his
      superiors. He hummed:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Sez all the little fishes that swim to and fro,
     She's the Liverpool packet&mdash;O Lord let her go!
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that gor-righteously fool ahead there think I blowed three whistles
      to salute Marston's birthday or their last dividend, Mr. Mayo?&rdquo; shouted
      Captain Wass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fogs are freaky; ocean mists are often eerie in movements. There are
      strata, there are eddying air-currents which rend the curtain or shred the
      massing vapors. The men in the pilot-house of the <i>Nequasset</i>
      suddenly found their range of vision widened. The fog did not clear; it
      became more tenuous and showed an area of the sea. It was like a thin veil
      which disclosed dimly what it distorted and magnified.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a fog, experienced steamboat men always examine with earnest gaze the
      line where fog and ocean merge. They do not stare up into the fog, trying
      to distinguish the loom of an on-coming craft; they are able to discern
      first of all the white line of foam marking the vessel's cutwater kick-up
      or her wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There she comes, sir!&rdquo; announced the mate. He pointed his finger at a
      foaming upthrust of tossing water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir! Eighteen knots and both eyes shut!&rdquo; But there was relief
      mingled with the resentment. His quick glance informed him that the liner
      would pass the <i>Nequasset</i> well to starboard&mdash;her bow showed a
      divergence of at least two points from the freighter's course. But the
      next instant Captain Wass yelped a shout of angry alarm. &ldquo;Yes, both eyes
      shut!&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right in line with the liner's threshing bow was a fisherman's Hampton
      boat, disclosed as the fog drifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passenger-steamer gave forth a half-dozen &ldquo;woofs&rdquo; from her whistle,
      answering the freighter's staccato warning, but gave no signs of slowing.
      But that they were making an attempt to dodge the mite in their path was
      made known by a shout from their lookout and his shrill call: &ldquo;Port! Hard
      over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fisherman had all the alertness of his kind, trained by dangers and
      ever-present prospect of mischance to grab at desperate measures. He
      leaped forward and pulled out his mast and tossed mast and sail overboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that he must encounter the tremendous wash and wake of the rushing
      hull. His shell of a boat, if made topheavy by the sail, would stand small
      show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a goner!&rdquo; gasped Captain Wass. &ldquo;She's a-going to tramp him plumb
      underfoot&mdash;unless she's going to get up a little more speed and jump
      over him!&rdquo; he added, moved to bitter sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      They saw the little boat go into eclipse behind the black prow, the first
      lift of the churning waters flipping the cockleshell as a coin is snapped
      by the thumb. The fisherman was not in view&mdash;he had thrown himself
      flat in the bottom of his boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's under for keeps,&rdquo; stated the skipper, with conviction. &ldquo;If her
      bilge-keel doesn't cooper him, her port propeller will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So rapidly was the liner moving, so abrupt her swoop to the right, that
      she leaned far over and showed them the red of her huge bilge. Her high
      speed enabled her to make an especially quick turn. As they gaped, her two
      stacks swung almost into line. Her shearing bow menaced the <i>Nequasset</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The condemned old hellion is going to nail <i>us</i>, now!&rdquo; bellowed
      Captain Wass. In his panic and his fury he leaped up and down, pulling at
      the whistle-cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was almost upon them&mdash;only a few hundred yards of gray water
      separated the two steamers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the <i>Triton!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Her name was disclosed on her bow. Her red hawse-holes showed like
      glowering and savage eyes. There was indescribably brutal threat in this
      sudden dart in their direction. It was as if a sea monster had swallowed
      an insect in the shape of a Hampton boat and now sought a real mouthful.
      But her great rudder swung to the quick pull of her steam steering-gear
      and again she sheered, cutting a letter s. The movement brought her past
      the stern of the <i>Nequasset</i>, a biscuit-toss away. The mighty surge
      of her roaring passage lifted the freighter's bulk aft, and the huge wave
      that was crowded between the two hulls crowned itself with frothing white
      and slapped a good, generous ton of green water over the smaller steamer's
      superstructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Wass grabbed down his megaphone; he wanted to submit a few remarks
      which seemed to fit the incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the captain of the Triton was beforehand with a celerity which matched
      the up-to-date speed of his craft. He was bellowing through the huge
      funnel which a quartermaster was holding for him. His language was
      terrific. He cursed freighters in most able style. He asked why the <i>Nequasset</i>
      was loafing there in the seaway without steering headway on her! That
      amazing query took away Captain Wass's breath and all power to retort.
      Asking that of a man who had obeyed the law to the letter! A fellow who
      was banging through the fog at eighteen knots' speed blaming a
      conscientious skipper because the latter had stopped so as to get out of
      the way!
    </p>
    <p>
      And, above all, going so fast when he asked the question that he was out
      of ear-shot before suitable answer could be returned!
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Wass revolved those whirling thoughts in a brain which flamed and
      showed its fires through the skipper's wide-propped eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he banged his megaphone across the pilot-house. It rebounded against
      him, and he kicked it into a corner. He began to whack his fist against a
      broad placard which was tacked up under his license as master. The
      cardboard was freshly white, and its tacks were bright, showing that it
      had been recently added as a feature of the pilot-house. Big letters in
      red ink at the top counseled, &ldquo;Safety First.&rdquo; Other big letters at the
      bottom warned, &ldquo;Take No Chances.&rdquo; The center lettering advised shipmasters
      that in case of accident the guilty parties would feel all the weight of
      Uncle Sam's heavy palm; it was the latest output from the Department of
      Commerce and Labor, and bore the signature of the honorable secretary of
      the bureau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo noted that his chief was wholly absorbed in this speechless activity;
      therefore he pulled the bells which stopped the backward churning and sent
      the freighter on her way. They passed the fisherman in the Hampton boat;
      he was bailing his craft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a rather close call, sir! I am glad that I have been trained by
      you to be a careful man. You took no chances!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where have I got to by obeying the United States rules and never
      taking chances, Mr. Mayo? At sixty-five I'm master of a freight-scow,
      sassed by owners ashore and sassed on the high seas by fellows like that
      one who just slammed past us! If that passenger-steamer had hit me the
      lawyers would have shoved the tar end of the stick into my hands! It's all
      for the good of the hellbent fellows the way things are arranged in this
      world at the present time. I'll be lucky if he doesn't lodge complaint
      against me when he gets to New York, saying that I got in his way!&rdquo; He cut
      off a fresh sliver of black plug and took his position at the
      whistle-pull. &ldquo;You'd better go get an heiress,&rdquo; he advised his mate,
      sourly. &ldquo;Being an old-fashioned skipper in these days of steam-boating is
      what I'm too polite to name. And as to being the other kind&mdash;well,
      you have just seen him whang past!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, as they went wallowing up the coast, their old tub sagging with
      the weight of the rails under her hatches, Mate Mayo felt considerable of
      a young man's ambitious envy of that spick-and-span swaggerer who had
      yelled anathema from the pilot-house of the <i>Triton</i>. It was real
      steamboating, he reflected, even if the demands of owners and
      dividend-seekers did compel a master to take his luck between his teeth
      and gallop down the seas.

      XVI ~ MILLIONS AND A MITE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     To Tiffany's I took her,
        I did not mind expense;
     I bought her two gold ear-rings,
        They cost me fifty cents.
        And a-a-away, you santee!
     My dear Annie!
        O you New York girls!
     Can't you dance the polka!
         &mdash;Shanty, &ldquo;The Lime Juicer.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Ralph Bradish, using one of the booth telephones in the Wall Street
      offices of Marston &amp; Waller, earnestly asked the cashier of an up-town
      restaurant, as a special favor, to hold for twenty-four hours the personal
      check, amount twenty-five dollars, given by Mr. Bradish the evening
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later, with the utmost nonchalance and quite certain that the
      document was as good as wheat, Mr. Bradish signed a check for one million
      two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      That amount in no measure astonished him. He was quite used to signing
      smashing-big checks when he was called into the presence of Julius
      Marston. Once, the amount named was two millions. And there had been
      numbers and numbers of what Mr. Bradish mentally termed &ldquo;piker checks&rdquo;&mdash;a
      hundred thousand, two and three hundred thousand. And he had never been
      obliged to request any hold up on those checks for want of funds. Because,
      in each instance, there had been a magic, printed line along which Mr.
      Bradish had splashed his signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he blotted the ink on this check Bradish glanced, with only idle
      curiosity, to note in what capacity he was serving this time. The printed
      line announced to him that he was &ldquo;Treasurer, the Paramount Coast
      Transportation Company, Inc.&rdquo; He remembered that in the past he had signed
      as treasurer of the &ldquo;Union Securities Company,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Amalgamated Holding
      Company,&rdquo; and for other corporations sponsoring railroads and big
      industries with whose destinies Julius Marston, financier, appeared to
      have much to do. It was evident that Financier Marston preferred to have a
      forty-dollar-a-week clerk do the menial work of check-signing, or at least
      to have that clerk's name in evidence instead of Marston's own.
    </p>
    <p>
      That modesty about having his name appear in public on a check seemed to
      attach to the business habits of Mr. Marston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mighty few person were ever admitted to this inner sanctuary where Bradish
      sat facing his employer across the flat-topped desk. And men who saw that
      employer outside his office did not turn their heads to stare after him or
      point respectful finger at him or remark to somebody else, &ldquo;There's the
      big Julius Marston.&rdquo; In the first place, Mr. Marston was not big in a
      physical sense, and there was nothing about him which would attract
      attention or cause him to be remarked in a crowd. And only a few persons
      really knew him, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat in his massive chair; one hand propped on the arm, his elbow
      akimbo, and with the other hand plucked slowly at the narrow strip of
      beard which extended from his lower lip to the peaked end of his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Mr. Bradish,&rdquo; he remarked, after the latter had lifted the
      blotter from the check.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradish rose and bowed, and started to leave. He was a tall and shapely
      young man, with a waist, with a carriage. His garb was up-to-the-minute
      fashion&mdash;repressed. He was a study in brown, as to fabric of attire
      and its accessories. One of those white-faced chaps who always look a bit
      bored, with a touch of up-to-date cynicism! One of those fellows who
      listen much and who say little!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment, Bradish,&rdquo; invited Marston, and the young man stopped. &ldquo;I
      like your way in these matters. You don't ask questions. You show no silly
      interest in any check you sign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bradish reflected an instant on the check in the restaurant cashier's
      drawer, and pinched his thin lips a little more tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm quite sure you don't do any broadcast talking about the nature of
      these special duties.&rdquo; The financier pointed to the check. &ldquo;I'll say quite
      frankly that I didn't select you for this service until I had ascertained
      that you did no talking about your own affairs in the office with my other
      clerks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bradish inclined his head respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In financial matters it is necessary to pick men carefully. I trust you
      understand my attitude. These transactions are quite legitimate. But
      modern methods of high finance make it necessary to manipulate the details
      a little. Your attitude in accepting these duties, as a matter of course
      is very gratifying from a business standpoint. As a little mark of our
      confidence in you, you will receive seventy-five dollars per week
      hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Martson allowed himself a quick, dry smile. &ldquo;This isn't a bribe, you
      understand. There is nothing attached to this nominal service which
      requires bribing. We merely want to make it worth while for a prudent and
      close-mouthed young man to remain with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A buzzer, as unobtrusive as were all the characteristics of Financier
      Marston, sounded its meek purr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he murmured into the receiver of the telephone which communicated
      with the watchful picket of the Marston &amp; Waller offices. &ldquo;Who? Oh,
      she may come in at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait here a moment, if you please, Mr. Bradish. It is my daughter who has
      dropped in for a moment's word with me. I have something more for you to
      attend to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bradish walked to one of the windows. He stared sharply at the girl who
      hurried in. Her hat and face were shrouded in an automobile veil, and the
      cloistered light of the big room helped to conceal her features. But
      Bradish seemed to recognize something about her in spite of the vagueness
      of outline. When she spoke to her father the young man's eyes snapped in
      true astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't explain it very well over the telephone, papa, so I came right
      down. Do forgive me if I bother you for just a minute.&rdquo; She glanced
      quickly at the young man beside the window, but found him merely an
      outline against the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one of our clerks,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;What is it, my girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Nan Burgess's house-party at Kingston! There's to be an automobile
      parade&mdash;all decorated&mdash;at the fête, and I want to go in our big
      car, and have it two days. I was afraid you'd say no if I asked you over
      the telephone, but now that I'm right here, looking you in the eyes with
      all the coaxing power of my soul, you just can't refuse, can you, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think perhaps I would have consented over the telephone, Alma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I may take the car?&rdquo; Her playful tones rose in ecstatic crescendo.
      The impulsiveness of her nature was displayed by her manner in accepting
      this favor. She danced to her father and threw her arms about him. She
      exhibited as much delight as if he had bestowed upon her a gift of
      priceless pearls. The exuberance of her joy appeared to annoy him a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gently, gently, Alma! If you waste your thanks in this manner for a
      little favor, what will you do some day for superlatives when you are
      really eager to thank some-body for a big gift?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'll always have thanks enough to go around&mdash;that's my
      disposition. The folks who love me, I can love them twice as much. You're
      a dear old dad, and I know you want me to run along so that you can go to
      making a lot more money. So I'll just take myself out from underfoot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she turned she glanced again at the person near the window, and this
      time she got a good look at his face. Even the veil could not hide from
      Bradish the color which spread into her cheeks. She was so conscious of
      her embarrassment and of her appearance that she did not turn her face to
      her father when he spoke to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Alma! Seeing that my big car is going to have a two days'
      vacation in the country, I may as well make it do one last business errand
      for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He called Bradish to the desk by a side jerk of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want that check put into the hands of the brokerage firm of Mower
      Brothers as quickly as possible. My car is at the door, and it may as well
      take you along. Alma, allow this young man of ours to ride with you to the
      place where I'm sending him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not present Bradish to Miss Marston. Bradish did not expect the
      financier to do so. But this dismissal of him as a mere errand-boy&mdash;with
      the young lady staring him out of countenance in a half-frightened way&mdash;did
      cut the pride a bit, even in the case of a mere clerk. And this clerk was
      pondering on the memory that only the night before he had clasped this
      young lady&mdash;then a party unknown who was evidently bent upon an
      escapade <i>incog</i>.&mdash;had encircled this selfsame maiden with his
      arms during many blissful dances in one of the gorgeous Broadway public
      ball-rooms. And he had regaled her and a girl friend on viands for which
      his twenty-five-dollar check had scarcely sufficed to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradish was pretty familiar with the phases and the oddities of the
      dancing craze, but this <i>contretemps</i> rather staggered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had asked no questions of each other during those dances. They had
      been perfectly satisfied with the joy of the moment. She had looked at him
      in a way and with a softness in her eyes which told him that she found him
      pleasing in her sight. She had been enthusiastic, with that same
      exuberance he had just witnessed, over his grace in the dance. They had
      promised to meet again at the ball-room where social conventions did not
      prevent healthy young folks from enjoying themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; she whispered to him, as she preceded him through the
      door. &ldquo;You work in my father's office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are surprised&mdash;a little shocked&mdash;and I don't blame you,&rdquo; he
      returned, humbly. &ldquo;As for me, I am simply astounded. But I am not a
      gossip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stole a look at his pale, impassive face, and some of her father's
      instinct in judging men seemed to reassure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must play a bit,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;And it's so stupid most of the time,
      among folks whom one knows very well. There are no more surprises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he shut the door softly behind them Bradish heard Marston, once more
      immersed in his affairs of business, directing over the telephone that one
      Fletcher Fogg be located and sent to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I apologize,&rdquo; said Bradish, in the corridor. They were waiting for the
      elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo; She lifted her eyebrows, and there was no hint of annoyance in
      her dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For&mdash;well&mdash;seeing how the matter stands, it almost seems as if
      I had presumed&mdash;was masquerading. I am only a clerk, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are a clerk in Julius Marston's offices,&rdquo; she said, with pride,
      &ldquo;and that means that you are to be trusted. I require no apology from you,
      Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Ralph Bradish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dodged away from dullness last evening; I was hoping to have a bit of a
      frolic. And I found a young gentleman who asked no impertinent questions,
      who was very gracious, and who was a delight in the dance. It was all very
      innocent&mdash;rather imprudent&mdash;but altogether lovely. There!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;well, after Nan Burgess's house-party, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced up at him, provocation in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't dare to hope, do I, that you will condescend to come again
      and dance with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julius Marston has taught his daughter to keep her promise, sir. If I
      remember, I promised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply, for the elevator's grille door clashed open for them to
      enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the elevator, and later in the car, he was silent, as became the
      clerk of Marston's offices in the company of Marston's daughter when there
      were listeners near.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes gave him distinct approval and her lips gave him a charming smile
      when he alighted at his destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradish stood for a moment and gazed after the car when it threaded its
      way into the Broadway traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's a flighty young dame, with a new notion for every minute,&rdquo; he told
      himself. &ldquo;You can see that plain enough. It's probably all jolly on her
      part. However, in these days, if a fellow keeps his head steady and his
      feet busy, there's no telling what the tango may lead to. This may be
      exactly, what I've been paying tailors' bills for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indicating that in these calculating times the spirit of youth in the
      ardor of love at first sight is not as the poet of romance has painted it.

    <h2>
      XVII ~ &ldquo;EXACTLY!&rdquo; SAID MR. FOGG
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;O I am not a man o' war or privateer,&rdquo; said he,
     Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we!
     &ldquo;But I'm an honest pirate a-looking for my fee,
     Cruising down along the coast of the High Barbaree.&rdquo;
                &mdash;Shanty of the &ldquo;Prince Luther.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Fletcher Fogg privately and mentally and metaphorically slapped
      himself on the back whenever he considered his many activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was perfectly certain that he was the best little two-handed general
      operator of an all-around character that any gentleman could secure when
      that gentleman wanted a job done and did not care to give explicit
      instructions as to the details of procedure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The look of grief and regret that the fat face of Mr. Fogg could assume
      when said gentleman&mdash;after the job was done&mdash;blamed the methods
      as unsanctioned, even though the result had been achieved&mdash;that
      expression was a study in humility&mdash;humility with its tongue in its
      cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Fogg could have advertised his business to suit himself&mdash;being
      not a whit ashamed of his tactics&mdash;he would have issued a card
      inscribed about as follows:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Mr. FLETCHER FOGG: Promoting and demoting. Building and
     busting. The whole inside of any financial or industrial
     cheese cleaned out without disturbing the outside rind. All
     still work done noiselessly. Plenty of brass bands for loud
     work. Broad shoulders supplied to take on all the blame.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg, in the presence of Julius Marston, was properly obsequious, but
      not a bit fawning. He wiped away the moisture patches beside his nose with
      a purple handkerchief, and put it back into his outside breast pocket with
      the corners sticking out like attentive ears. He crossed his legs and set
      on his knee an ankle clothed in a purple silk stocking. On account of his
      rotundity he was compelled to hold the ankle in place in the firm clutch
      of his hand. He settled his purple tie with the other hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad I was in reach when you wanted me,&rdquo; he assured Mr. Marston. &ldquo;I'm
      just in on the <i>Triton</i>. And I want to tell you that you're running
      that steamboat line in the way an American business man wants to have it
      run. If I had been on any other line, sir, I wouldn't have been here
      to-day when you were looking for me. Everything else on the coast prowling
      along half-speed, but down slammed the old <i>Triton</i>, scattering 'em
      out from underfoot like an auto going through a flock of chickens, but not
      a jar or a scrape or a jolt, and into her dock, through two days of thick
      fog, exactly on the dot. That's the way an American wants to be carried,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so, Mr. Fogg,&rdquo; agreed Julius Marston. &ldquo;And that's why we feel
      it's going to be a good thing for all the coast lines to be under one
      management&mdash;our management.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's true progress&mdash;true benefit to travelers, stockholders, and all
      concerned. Consolidation instead of rivalry. I believe in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a broad-gauged business man&mdash;big enough to grasp big matters&mdash;you
      have seen how consolidation effects reforms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No two ways about it,&rdquo; affirmed Mr. Fogg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was very good missionary work you did in the matter of the Sound
      &amp; Cape line&mdash;very good indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's astonishing what high and lofty ideas some stockholders have about
      properties they're interested in. In financial matters the poorest
      conclusion a man can draw is that a stock will always continue to pay
      dividends simply because it always has done so. I had to set off a pretty
      loud firecracker to wake those Sound &amp; Cape fellows up. I had to show
      'em what damage the new deals and competition and our combination would do
      to 'em if they kept on sleeping on their stock certificates. Funny how
      hard it is to pry some folks loose from their par-value notions.&rdquo; Mr. Fogg
      delivered this little disquisition on the intractability of stockholders
      with reproachful vigor, staring blandly into the unwinking gaze of Mr.
      Marston. &ldquo;I don't want to praise my own humble efforts too much,&rdquo; he went
      on, &ldquo;but I truly believe that inside another thirty days the Sound crowd
      would have been ready to cash in at fifty, in spite of that minority bunch
      that was hollering for par. That was only a big yawp from a few folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifty was a fair price in view of what's ahead in the way of competition,
      but we have made it a five-eighths proposition in order to clinch the deal
      promptly. I just sent one of our boys around with the check.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg beamed. He used his purple handkerchief on his cheeks once more.
      He allowed to himself a few words of praise: &ldquo;They'll understand some day
      that I saved 'em from a bigger bump. But it's hard to show some people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Fogg, we come to the matter of the Vose line. What's the
      outlook?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg looked sad. &ldquo;After weeks of chasing 'em, I can only say that
      they're ugly and stubborn, simply blind to their best interests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insist on par, do they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse than that. Old Vose and his sons and those old hornbeam directors&mdash;retired
      sea-captains, you know, as hard as old turtles&mdash;they have taken a
      stand against consolidation. They belong in the dark ages of business. Old
      Vose had the impudence to tell me that forming this steamboat combine was
      a crime, and that he wouldn't be a party to a betrayal of the public. He
      won't come in; he won't sell; he's going to compete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Marston stroked his strip of beard. &ldquo;In order for our stock to be what
      we intend it to be, the Paramount Coast Transportation has got to operate
      as a complete monopoly, as you understand, Mr. Fogg. A beneficent monopoly&mdash;consolidation
      benefiting all&mdash;but nevertheless a monopoly. With one line holding
      out on us, we've got only a limping proposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we going to do about the Vose line?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it compete, sir. We can kill it in the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly&mdash;probably. But that plan will not serve, Mr. Fogg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is not finance. I'm looking at this proposition solely as a
      financier, Mr. Fogg. I hardly know one end of a steamboat from the other.
      I'm not interested in rate-cutting problems. I don't know how long it
      would take to put the Vose line under. But I do know this, as a financier,
      handling a big deal, that the Paramount stock will not appeal to investors
      or the bonds to banks unless we can launch our project as a clean, perfect
      combination, every transportation charter locked up. I handle money, and I
      know all of money's timidity and all of money's courage. You think the
      Vose directors are able to hold their stockholders in line, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg uncrossed his legs, put both feet on the floor, hooked his hands
      across his paunch, and gazed up at the ceiling, evidently pondering
      profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat, I'm not viewing this thing as a steamboating proposition, not
      figuring what kind of tariffs will kill competition,&rdquo; stated Mr. Marston.
      &ldquo;I'm not estimating what kind of tariffs will make a profit for the
      Paramount. I'd as soon sell sugar over the counter. My associates expect
      me to make money for them in another way&mdash;make it in big lumps and on
      a quick turn. The Vose line, competing, kills us from the financial
      viewpoint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence in the room for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's never any telling what stockholders will do,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Fogg,
      his eyes still studying the panels of the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Marston did not dispute that dictum.
    </p>
    <p>
      His field-marshal slowly tipped down his head and gave his superior
      another of those bland stares.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I'll go right ahead and see what they'll do, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and kicked the legs of his trousers into place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand that in this affair, as in all matters where you have been
      employed, there must be absolutely clean work. There must be no come-back.
      Of course, I have instructed you to this effect regularly, but I wish to
      have you remember that I have repeated the instructions, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; Mr. Fogg's eyes did not blink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be prepared to testify to that effect in case the need ever
      arises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg delivered that word like a countersign. Into it, in his
      interviews with Julius Marston, he put understanding, humility, promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May we expect quick action?&rdquo; asked the financier. &ldquo;The thing mustn't hang
      fire. We have a lot of our nimble money tied up as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; returned Mr. Fogg, on his way to the door. &ldquo;Quick action it
      is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is probably the craziest idea that ever popped into a man's head
      when that man was sitting in Julius Marston's office,&rdquo; reflected Mr. Fogg,
      marching through the anteroom of this temple of finance. &ldquo;There's one
      thing about it that's comforting&mdash;it's so wild-eyed it will never be
      blamed on to Julius Marston as any of his getting up. And that's his
      principal lookout when a deal is on. It seems to be up to me to deliver
      the goods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on a bench in the waiting-room and rubbed his knuckles over
      his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just let me get this thing right end to,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;How did the
      idea happen to hit me, anyway? Oh, yes! Old Vose bragging to me that every
      stockholder in the Vose line was behind him, and that the annual meeting
      was about to come off, and then I would see what a condemned poor show I
      stood to get even the toe of my boot into the crack of the company door.
      He's a Maine corporation. I've known of cases where that fact helped a
      lot. There are plenty of ifs and buts in this thing, but here goes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He applied himself to one of the office telephones, asked for several
      numbers, one after the other, and put questions with eagerness and
      rapidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The information he received seemed to disturb him considerably. He came
      out of the booth and scrubbed his cheeks with his purple handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their annual meeting at ten o'clock to-morrow morning, four hundred miles
      from here! Well, I suppose I ought to be thankful that it's not being held
      right now,&rdquo; Mr. Fogg informed himself, determined to fan that one flicker
      of hope with both wings of his optimism. &ldquo;But I've got to admit that
      twenty-four hours is almighty scant time for a job of this sort, even when
      the operator is the little Fogg boy himself. Damme, I haven't come to a
      full, realizing sense yet of all I've got to do and how I'm going to do
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried out, dove into an elevator, and was shot down to the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was lucky enough to find a taxi at the curb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grand Central,&rdquo; he told the driver. &ldquo;I've got five dollars that says you
      can beat the Subway express and land me in season for the ten-o'clock
      limited for Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as it became evident to Mr. Fogg that his driver had seen his duty
      and was going to do it, traffic squad be blowed, the promoter settled
      back, and his thoughts began to revolve faster than the taxi's wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's going to be like the mining-camp 'lulu hand,'&rdquo; was his mental
      preface to his plans. &ldquo;It can be played only once in a sitting-in; it has
      got to be backed with good bluff, but it's a peach when it works. And what
      am I a promoter for? What have I studied foreign corporation laws for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg took off his hat and mopped his bald spot, wrinkling his eyelids
      in deep reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea is,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;I'm a candidate for the presidency of the Vose
      line at to-morrow's meeting. But I haven't been elected yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, Mr. Fogg's preliminary sniffing at the affairs of the Vose line
      had informed him where he could pick up at least ten scattered shares of
      their stock. He figured that before midnight he would have them in his
      possession. As to the next day and the next steps, well, the nerve of a
      real American plunger clings to life until the sunset of all hopes, even
      as the snake's tail, though the serpent's head be bruised beyond repair,
      is supposed to wriggle until sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      He despatched a telegram at New Haven. He received a reply at Providence,
      and he read it and felt like a gambler who has drawn a card to fill his
      bobtail hand. When a design is brazen and the game is largely a bluff,
      plain, lucky chance must be appealed to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The telegram had been addressed to Attorney Sawyer Franklin, in a Maine
      city. It had requested an appointment with Mr. Franklin on the following
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reply had stated that Mr. Franklin was critically ill in a hospital,
      but that all matters of business would be attended to by his office force,
      as far as was possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attorney Sawyer Franklin, as Mr. Fogg, of course, was fully aware, was
      clerk of the Vose line corporation, organized according to the Maine law
      as a &ldquo;foreign corporation,&rdquo; under the more liberal regulations which have
      attracted so many metropolitan promoters into the states of Maine and New
      Jersey.

      XVIII ~ HOW AN ANNUAL MEETING WAS HELD&mdash;ONCE!
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     O, a ship she was rigged and ready for sea,
     And all of her sailors were fishes to be!
          Windy-y-weather,
              Stormy-y-weather!
     When the wind blows we're all together!
                       &mdash;The Fishes.
</pre>
    <p>
      Fletcher Fogg, suave, dignified, radiating business importance, freshened
      by a barber's ministrations, walked into the Franklin law-offices the next
      morning at nine-thirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He announced himself to a girl typist, and she referred him to a young man
      who came forth from a private room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have power of attorney from Mr. Franklin to transact his routine
      business,&rdquo; explained the young man. &ldquo;Of course, if it's a new case or a
      question of law&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither, neither, my dear sir! Simply a matter of routine. But,&rdquo; he
      leaned close to the young man's ear, &ldquo;strictly private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg himself closed the door of the inner office when the two had
      retired there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of your matters to-day, I believe, is the annual meeting of the Vose
      line. I am a stockholder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fogg produced a packet of certificates and laid them on the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there to be any officers or other stockholders present?&rdquo; he asked,
      showing just a bit of solicitude, in spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; returned the young man. &ldquo;Nothing has been said about it.
      The proxies and instructions have been sent in, as usual, by registered
      mail.&rdquo; He indicated documents stacked on the desk. &ldquo;I was just about to
      begin on the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose our proxies run to the clerk of the corporation, as usual, with
      full power of substitution, clerk to follow instructions,&rdquo; said Mr. Fogg,
      a bit pompously, using his complete knowledge of corporation routine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. We handle most of the corporation meetings that way when it's
      all cut and dried. In this case, it's simply a re-election of the old
      officers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg pulled his chair closer, dabbed his purple handkerchief on each
      side of his nose, and inquired, kindly and confidentially: &ldquo;My son, what's
      your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;David Boyne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Law student here&mdash;secretary, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly&mdash;and a long, hard pull ahead of you. It's too bad you're not
      in New York, where a young man doesn't have to travel the whole way
      around, but can cut a corner or two. I could give you a lot of examples of
      bright young chaps who have grabbed in when the grabbing was good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I haven't the time. You take my word for it. I'm a plain, outspoken
      business man, and I'm in with the biggest financial interests in New York.
      And I'm going to offer you the grandest opportunity of your life right
      now, David.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He picked up his certificates and arranged them in one hand, as a player
      arranges his cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have here ten shares, say, and each share is owned by a different
      individual&mdash;all good men. You don't know them, but I do. They are
      connected with our big interests. And I'm right here as a stockholder. Do
      you realize, David, that instructing you to hold this meeting without a
      single stockholder present is really asking you to do something that's not
      strictly legal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We usually do it this way,&rdquo; faltered Boyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly! Men like those who are running the Vose line are always asking
      an innocent man to do something illegal. I'm going to come right to the
      point with you, David. Those old moss-backs who have sent those
      instructions are trying to wreck the Vose line. I want you to disregard
      those instructions. I am anxious to be president and general manager of
      the line. I want you to elect as directors these stockholders.&rdquo; He tapped
      his finger on the certificates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man was both frightened and bewildered. He turned pale. &ldquo;I can't
      do that,&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you can. There are the proxies. It's up to you to vote 'em as you
      want to. They allow full power of substitution, usual fashion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can't disobey my instructions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say you can, if you've got grit enough to make a good thing for
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a thing was never done here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not. It's a new idea. But new things are being done right along
      in high finance. You ought to be up where big things are happening every
      day. You stand in with me, and I'll put you there. You see, I'm getting
      right down to cases on this matter with you, David. Vote those proxies as
      I direct and I'll hand you five thousand dollars inside of two hours, and
      will plant you in a corking job with my people as soon as this thing calms
      down. I could have palavered a long time before coming to business in this
      way, but I see you're a bright young fellow and don't need a lot of
      hair-oil talk. I don't ask you to hurt anybody in especial. You can elect
      the old treasurer&mdash;we don't want to handle the money&mdash;this is no
      cheap brace game. But I want a board of directors who will put me in as
      general manager until certain reforms can be instituted so as to bring the
      line up to date. Five thousand dollars, mind you, and then you'll be taken
      care of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'll be put into state prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, my boy! Why would you vote those proxies according to your
      instructions? Why, because it would be for your interest to do so if I
      hadn't come in here with a better proposition. Now it's for your interest
      to vote 'em as I tell you. The most they can make out of it is a breach of
      trust, and that amounts to nothing. With five thousand dollars in your
      mitt, you wouldn't need to hang around here to take a lot of slurs. I'll
      slip you another thousand for your expenses on a little trip till the air
      is all clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boyne stared at this blunt and forceful tempter; his hand which clutched
      the chair-arms trembled; &ldquo;I'm going to be still more frank with you, my
      boy. And, by the way, you must know that I'm no mere four-flusher. You've
      heard of Fletcher Fogg, eh? You knew who I was when you got that wire from
      me yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, I know of you through our corporation work, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; Mr. Fogg assumed even more unctuously the manner of an old
      friend. &ldquo;Now, as I say, I'm going to be frank&mdash;take you in on the
      ground floor. Of course, they can have another&mdash;a special meeting of
      the Vose line after a thirty days' notice to the stockholders. They will
      probably call that meeting, and I don't care if they do. But I have an
      ambition to be general manager of the line for those thirty days to make&mdash;well,
      I want to make a little investigation of general conditions,&rdquo; declared Mr.
      Fogg, resorting to his purple handkerchief. &ldquo;That's all I care to say. At
      the end of thirty days we may&mdash;I'm speaking of the big interests I
      represent&mdash;we may decide to buy the line and make it really worth
      something to the stockholders. You understand, I hope. It's strictly
      business&mdash;it's all right&mdash;it's good financiering. After it's all
      over and those old, hardshell directors wake up, I'll venture to say
      they'll be pleased all around that this little turn has been made. In the
      mean time, having been taken care of, you needn't mind whether they're
      pleased or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boyne looked at the sheaf of certificates in Fogg's hand; he bent
      frightened gaze on the documents stacked on the desk. They lay there
      representing his responsibility, but they also represented opportunity.
      The sight of them was a rebuke to the agitated thoughts of treason which
      assailed him. But the mere papers had no voice to make that rebuke
      pointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg did have a voice. &ldquo;Five thousand dollars in your fist, my boy, as
      soon as I can work the wire to New York&mdash;and there's no piker about
      the man who can have five thousand flashed in here when he asks for it.
      You can see what kind of men are behind me. What do you care about old man
      Vose and his crowd?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's Mr. Franklin! I'll be doing a mighty mean trick, Mr. Fogg. No,
      I'll not do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg did not bluster. He was silent for some time. He pursed his lips
      and stared at Boyne, and then he shifted his gaze to the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too bad&mdash;too bad for a young fellow to turn down such an
      opportunity,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;It can be done without you, Boyne, in another
      way. The same result will happen. But you might as well be in on it. Now
      let me tell you a few instances of how some of the big men in this country
      got their start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg was an excellent raconteur with a vivid imagination, and it did
      not trouble his conscience because the narratives he imparted to this
      wide-eyed youth were largely apocryphal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he put in at the end of the first tale, &ldquo;what a flying start
      will do for a man. Suppose that chap I've just told you about sat back and
      refused to jump when the road was all open to him! You don't hear anybody
      knocking that man nowadays, do you? And yet that's the trick he pulled to
      get his start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a similar snapper did Mr. Fogg touch up each one of his stories of
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn't have any idea&mdash;I thought they managed it some other
      way,&rdquo; murmured David Boyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your horizon has been limited; you haven't been out in the world enough
      to know, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard of all those men, of course. They're big men to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't think they got to be millionaires by saving the money out of
      clerks' salaries, did you? Of course, Boyne, I admit that in this affair
      you'll be up to a little sharp practice. But you're not stealing anything.
      Nobody can lug off steamships in a vest pocket. It's only a deal&mdash;and
      deals are being made every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fogg was a keen judge of his fellow-men. He knew weakness when he saw it.
      He could determine from a man's lower lip and the set of his nose whether
      that person were covetous. And he knew now what signified the flush on
      Boyne's cheeks and the light in his eyes. However, there was something
      else to reckon with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not betray Mr. Franklin's confidence in me. Positively, I will
      not,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;He's sick, and that would make it worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How sick is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very, very ill. It was an operation, and he has had a relapse. But
      we hope he's coming out all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hospital is he in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boyne gave the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I'll call up and ask when it is expected that he can see
      visitors,&rdquo; announced Fogg, with business briskness. &ldquo;I wish Franklin had
      been here on deck&mdash;Franklin, himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe Mr. Franklin would turn a trick of this sort,&rdquo; asserted
      the clerk. &ldquo;I'd hate to face him, after doing it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Franklin would be able to see further into a financial deal than a young
      chap,&rdquo; said Mr. Fogg, severely, and then he found his number and made his
      call. &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; he blurted, after a question. &ldquo;I am in his office.
      Yes, I'll tell Boyne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a fine affectation of grief and surprise, he snapped the transmitter
      upon the hook and whirled on Boyne. His back had been toward the young man&mdash;he
      had spoken with hand across the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has just died&mdash;he's dead! Franklin has passed away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have been notified,&rdquo; gasped Boyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were just going to call you. You heard me say I'd inform you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must call the hospital&mdash;offer my services. I must go up
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg put out his hand and pressed the young man back into his chair.
      &ldquo;A lulu must be played quick and the pot raked sudden,&rdquo; he reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment, my son. Now you're standing on your own bottom. You won't
      have to explain to Mr. Franklin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to the clock. His stories had consumed time. The hour was
      ten-thirty-five.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That annual meeting of the Vose line was called for ten of the clock
      to-day. Mr. Franklin was alive at that hour. He was the clerk of that
      corporation. What happens now will not embarrass you so far as he's
      concerned. Be sensible. Make a stroke for yourself. You're out of a job,
      anyway. Go to it, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fogg spoke sharply, imperiously. He exerted over the young man all the
      force of his personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five thousand dollars&mdash;protected by my interests&mdash;slipped out
      of sight for a few months&mdash;it's easy. Sit down there and make up your
      records; vote those proxies. Vote 'em, I say. This meeting was held at ten
      o'clock. Make up your records.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood over Boyne, arguing, promising, urging, and the young man, at
      last, sweating, flushed, trembling, bent over his documents, sorted them,
      and made up his records.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll send on a copy to the office of the Vose line by registered mail,&rdquo;
       commanded Fogg. &ldquo;Attest it as a copy of the true record by notary. When it
      drops in on 'em I will be there, with my directors and my little story&mdash;and
      the face of Uncle Vose will be worth looking at, though his language may
      not be elevating. You come out with me, Boyne. I'm going to the telegraph
      office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must get in touch at once with Mr. Franklin's family&mdash;offer my
      services,&rdquo; pleaded the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't a thing you can do right now,&rdquo; snapped the masterful
      gentleman from New York. &ldquo;I suggest that you close the office. Send the
      girl home. You should do that much out of respect to your employer's
      memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later the record had been mailed and the flustered Boyne was
      trotting around town with Mr. Fogg. The latter seemed to have a tremendous
      amount of business on his hands. He hired a cab and was hustled yon and
      thither, leaving the young man in the vehicle, with instructions to stay
      there, whenever a stop was made. But at last Mr. Fogg returned from an
      errand with some very tangible results. He put a packet of bank-notes into
      Boyne's shaking hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see as much real money before, my son?&rdquo; asked Fogg,
      genially. &ldquo;That's your five thousand. And here's five hundred toward that
      expense money we promised. I'm suggesting that you leave town to-night.
      Tuck that cash away on yourself and duck out of sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having secured the money and placed that powerful argument in the young
      man's hands, Mr. Fogg's hurry and anxiety seemed to be over. When he had
      seen the packet buttoned inside Boyne's coat he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trade is clinched and the job is done, son, and I feel sure that,
      being a healthy young American citizen with plenty of cash to pay your
      way, you're not going to let go that cash nor do any foolish squealing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've gone too far to back out,&rdquo; admitted Boyne, patting the outside of
      his coat. &ldquo;But it seems like a dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard a little piece of good news while I've been running around&mdash;forgot
      to tell you,&rdquo; said Fogg, in a matter-of-fact way. &ldquo;That fool attendant at
      the hospital must have misunderstood me, or I misunderstood him. Franklin
      isn't dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He-isn't-dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Last report is that he's better this forenoon. But that's the way
      some of these crazy attendants mix things up when anybody inquires at a
      hospital. Now, of course, seeing that the registered copy is on its way
      and Franklin is getting better, that's all the more reason why you don't
      care to hang around these diggings and be annoyed. I've got a scheme. It
      will take you out of town in a very quiet style. I have telephoned down to
      the docks, and there's a Vose freighter in here discharging rails. Do you
      live at home or at a boarding-place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I board,&rdquo; said Boyne, still wrestling with the sickening information that
      he had betrayed an employer who was alive; somehow the sentiment that it
      was equally base to betray a deceased employer had not impressed itself on
      his benumbed conscience. He was now keenly aware that he feared to meet up
      with a living and indignant Lawyer Franklin. Fogg questioned, and Boyne
      gave his boarding-house address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll drive there, and I'll wait outside in the cab until you can scratch
      together a gripful of your things. Don't load yourself down too much.
      Remember, you've got plenty of cash in your pockets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little later Fogg escorted the young man up the gang-plank of the <i>Nequasset</i>,
      from whose hold the last of her load of clanging rails was being derricked
      by panting windlass engines. To Captain Zoradus Wass, who was lounging
      against the rail just outside the pilot-house, Mr. Fogg marched with
      business promptitude, and spoke with assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain, my name is Fletcher Fogg. Within forty-eight hours the directors
      of the Vose line will elect me president and general manager. That news
      may be rather astonishing, but it's true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The veteran skipper did not reply. He shifted a certain bulge from one
      cheek to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; queried Fogg, a bit sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't saying anything&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe what I tell you, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This young man is David Boyne, acting clerk of the Vose line corporation.
      The annual meeting has just been held in this city. He made the official
      records. He will tell you that a new board of directors has been chosen&mdash;the
      old crowd is out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; stated Boyne, obeying the prompting of Fogg's quick glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know you, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg was not abashed. &ldquo;It isn't especially necessary that you know us.
      How soon do you leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're going out light as soon as them rails are on the wharf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sending Mr. Boyne with you on a tour of inspection, captain. Please
      give him quarters and use him right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing doing till I get orders from the owners,&rdquo; declared Captain Wass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't I told you that I shall be general manager of this line
      to-morrow, or next day, at the latest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you're general manager come around and give off your orders, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do it. I'll come aboard in New York&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm ordered to Philadelphia,&rdquo; prompted Captain Wass. &ldquo;That's where you'll
      find me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philadelphia, then! I'll come aboard and fire you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do just as you feel like doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refuse to take along this young man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This ain't a passenger-boat. I don't know you. Show orders from owners&mdash;otherwise
      nothing doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mate Mayo had come out of his cabin, near at hand. With a young man's
      quicker perception of possibilities and contingencies he realized that his
      skipper might be letting an old man's obstinacy block common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first mate had an eye for men and their manners. He had been listening
      to Mr. Fogg. That gentleman certainly seemed to know what he was talking
      about. And young Mate Mayo, having a nose for news as well as an eye for
      men, understood that the coast transportation business was in a touchy
      state generally. He gave Mr. Fogg further inspection and decided that a
      little skilful compromising was advisable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Wass, will you step aside with me a moment?&rdquo; asked the mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to have a word with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have it right here,&rdquo; said the captain, tartly. &ldquo;I never have any business
      that's got to be whispered behind corners.&rdquo; He scowled when his mate gave
      him a wink, both suggestive and imploring. &ldquo;Spit it out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The law doesn't allow us to take passengers, as you suggest. And
      naturally you don't like to act without orders from owners.&rdquo; He looked at
      Mr. Fogg as he spoke, plainly offering apology to that gentleman. &ldquo;But we
      need a second steward and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't!&rdquo; Captain Wass was blunt and tactless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon&mdash;we really do. And we can sign this young man in a&mdash;a
      sort of nominal way, and then when we get to Philadelphia we'll probably
      find the matter all straightened out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's your name?&rdquo; asked Mr. Fogg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boyd Mayo, sir. First mate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Mayo, you're a young man with a lot of common sense,&rdquo; declared Fogg.
    </p>
    <p>
      To himself, staring at the young man, he said: &ldquo;I'm going to play this
      game out with two-spots, and here's one ready for the draw!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see you in Philadelphia, Mr. Mayo,&rdquo; he continued, aloud. &ldquo;I am
      exactly what I say I am. Captain Wass, you've got something coming to you.
      Mr. Mayo, you've got something coming to you, also&mdash;and it's good!&rdquo;
       His assertiveness was compelling, and even the captain displayed symptoms
      of being impressed. &ldquo;It isn't at all necessary that my agent make this
      trip with you, Captain Wass. Perhaps I had no distinct right to bring him
      here. But I am a hustling sort of a business man and I want to get at
      matters in short order. However, I ask no favors. Come on, Boyne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll sign him on as steward to cover the law,&rdquo; proffered the captain, as
      terse in consent as he was in refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; agreed Fogg. &ldquo;You've got an able first mate, sir.&rdquo; He flipped
      his watch out. &ldquo;I've got a train to make, gentlemen. Good day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took Boyne by the arm and led him to the ladder from the bridge. &ldquo;Son,&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;you dig into that Mayo chap till you know him up and down and
      through and through. I'm going to use him. And you keep your mouth shut
      about yourself.&rdquo; He backed down the ladder, feeling his way cautiously
      with his fat legs, trotted to the waiting cab, and was whirled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      At high noon the next day Fletcher Fogg marched into the general offices
      of the Vose line in company with ten solid-looking citizens. Imperturbable
      and smiling, he allowed President Vose to shriek anathema and to wave the
      certified copy of the record of the annual meeting under the snub Fogg
      nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say doesn't change the situation in the least,&rdquo; affirmed Mr.
      Fogg. &ldquo;You'll find the actual records of the meeting deposited in the
      usual place in the state of your incorporation. If you think these new
      directors are not lawfully and duly elected, you can apply to the courts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You confounded thief, it's likely to take a year to get a decision. This
      is damnable. It's piracy. You know what courts are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poke up your courts, then. It isn't my fault if they're slow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The new directors filed into the board-room and with great celerity
      proceeded to elect Fletcher Fogg to be president and general manager of
      the Vose line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; pleaded the deposed executive head. &ldquo;My money
      is in here&mdash;my whole life is in it&mdash;my pride&mdash;my intention
      to see that the public gets a square deal. You infernal rogue, what are
      you going to do with my property?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's my own business,&rdquo; said Fletcher Fogg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't get away with it&mdash;you can't do it!&rdquo; raged Vose. &ldquo;I'll get
      at the inside of how that meeting was conducted. You'd better take
      backwater right now, Fogg, and save yourself. I'm not afraid to tell you
      what I'm going to do. I'll have a temporary injunction issued. I'll prove
      fraud was used at that meeting&mdash;bribery, yes, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg smiled and sat down at the president's desk. &ldquo;First he'll have to
      find a young man by the name of David Boyne,&rdquo; he told himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vose,&rdquo; said the new president, &ldquo;all you can show a court is the record of
      an annual meeting, duly and legally held. And if the judge wants to have a
      look at me he'll find me running this line a blamed sight better than you
      have ever run it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a cheap, plain trick,&rdquo; bleated the aged steamship manager. &ldquo;Your
      crowd is going to sell out to the Paramount&mdash;it's your plot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! We're not inviting injunctions and law and newspaper talk and
      slurs and slander, Mr. Vose. If there's ever any selling out you'll be the
      first to suggest it; I never shall. You see, I'm just as frank with you as
      you are with me. Selling this line to the Paramount right now, just
      because the new board is in, would be ragged work&mdash;very coarse work.
      Thank Heaven, I have a proper respect for the law&mdash;and what it can do
      to bother a fool. I am not a fool, Mr. Vose.&rdquo;

      XIX ~ THE PRIZE PACKAGE FROM MR. FOGG
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Our captain stood on his quarter-deck,
        And a fine little man was he!
     &ldquo;Overhaul, overhaul, on your davit tackle fall,
        And launch your boats to the sea,
              Brave boys! And launch your boats to the sea.&rdquo;
                                &mdash;The Whale.
</pre>
    <p>
      A slowing, tug, tooting fussy and staccato blasts which Captain Wass
      translated into commands to hold up, intercepted the <i>Nequasset</i> in
      Hampton Roads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fletcher Fogg was a passenger on the tug. In a suit of natty gray, he
      loomed conspicuously in the alley outside the tug's pilot-house. He cursed
      roundly when he toilsomely climbed the ladder to the freighter's deck, for
      the rusty sheathing smutched the knees of his trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm doing a little better than I promised you, captain,&rdquo; he stated when
      he arrived finally in the presence of the master. &ldquo;I said Philadelphia.
      But here I am. Do you know me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name is Fogg,&rdquo; returned Captain Wass, exhibiting no special delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'm manager of this line. As it seems to be pretty hard for you to
      get anything through that thick nut of yours, I'll ask you to glance at a
      paper which will save argument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The paper was an attested notification, signed by the directors, stating
      in laconic legal phrase what Mr. Fogg had just declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You recognize my authority, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your bill o' lading reads O. K.,&rdquo; assented the skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! Exactly! Then you take your orders. Proceed to an anchorage
      off Lambert Point below Norfolk, pick a berth well off the channel, and
      put down both hooks. The boat is going out of commission. I find you're
      not making any money for the owners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't my fault. With charters at&mdash;&rdquo; began the master,
      indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't any time for a joint debate. You are laid off. Bring your
      accounts to the main office as soon as you have turned the steamer over to
      the caretaker&mdash;he'll come out from Norfolk.&rdquo; Manager Fogg turned on
      his heel to meet Mate Mayo. &ldquo;You will report at the main offices, too, Mr.
      Mayo. Have you master's papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, sir&mdash;Atlantic waters, Jacksonville to East-port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good&mdash;you're going to be promoted. I shall put you aboard the
      passenger-steamer <i>Montana</i> as captain.&rdquo; He looked about sharply.
      &ldquo;Where is my agent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, in the quartermaster's cabin. We gave him that,&rdquo; replied Captain
      Wass, gruffly. &ldquo;I'm glad I'm out of steamboating. I've learned how to run
      a boarding-house and make money out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg did not understand that sneer, and he paid no attention to the
      captain's manner. He started for the cabin indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can swell around in gold braid now and catch your heiress,&rdquo;
       observed Captain Wass to his mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, skipper,&rdquo; said the young man, with real feeling. &ldquo;You are the
      man to be promoted, not I. It isn't right&mdash;it doesn't seem real.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't any real steamboating on this coast any longer. It is&mdash;I
      don't know what the devil it is,&rdquo; snarled the veteran. &ldquo;I have been
      sniffing and scouting. I'd like to be a mouse in the wall of them New York
      offices and hear what it is they're trying to do to us poor cusses.
      Ordered one day to keep the law; ordered the next day to break the law;
      hounded by owners and threatened by the government! I'm glad I'm out of it
      and glad you've got a good job. That last I'm specially glad about. But
      keep your eye peeled. There are queer doings round about you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fogg entered the cabin and shut the door behind him. He found Boyne
      sitting on a stool and looking somewhat apprehensive. &ldquo;Hiding?&rdquo; inquired
      Fogg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I wouldn't show myself till I was sure about who was on that
      tug,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the boy, David,&rdquo; complimented Fogg, with real heartiness. &ldquo;You're
      no fool. Nothing like being careful. Pack your bag and go aboard the tug.&rdquo;
       He marched out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philadelphia charter has been canceled, eh?&rdquo; asked Captain Wass. The tone
      of his voice did not invite amity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems queer to turn down a cargo that's there waiting&mdash;and the old
      boat can carry it cheaper than anybody else, the way I've got expenses
      fined down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you trying to tell me my business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have beep steamboating forty years, and I know a little something about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg looked at the old mariner, eyes narrowed. He wanted to inform
      Captain Wass that the latter knew altogether too much about steamboating
      for the kind of work that was planned out along the coast in those
      ticklish times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I ain't to expect anything special from now on?&rdquo; asked the skipper.
      In spite of his determination to be crusty and keep his upper lip stiff,
      he could not repress a little wistfulness, and his eyes roved over the old
      freighter with affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing, sir!&rdquo; Mr. Fogg was blunt and cool. He started for the
      ladder. He slapped the shoulder of Mayo as he passed the young man.
      &ldquo;Here's the kind of chap we're looking for nowadays. The sooner you
      report, my boy, the better for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With Boyne following him, he climbed down the swaying ladder, and was
      lifted from the lower rungs over the tug's rail to a secure footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the lines had been cast off and the tug went floundering away at a
      sharp angle, Captain Wass scuffed into his pilot-house and gave the bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She seems to feel it&mdash;honest she does!&rdquo; he told Mate Mayo. &ldquo;She goes
      off logy. She doesn't pick up her heels. Nor could I do it when I walked
      in here. Going to be scrapped&mdash;the two of us! Cuss their picking and
      stealing and fighting and financing. They ain't steam-boating any longer.
      They're using good boats to play checkers in Wall Street with. Well, son,&rdquo;
       he mourned, hanging dispiritedly over the sill of the window and staring
      up the wind-swept Chesapeake, &ldquo;I ain't going to whine&mdash;but I shall
      miss the old packet and the rumble and racket of the old machine down
      there in her belly. I'd even take the job of watchman aboard her if he
      would hire me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to fancy me a bit. I'll ask him to hire you,&rdquo; proffered the
      mate, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you didn't get the look in his eye when he fired me,&rdquo; said
      Captain Wass. &ldquo;I won't allow you to say a word to him about me. You go
      ahead, boy, and take the job he has offered. But always remember that he's
      a slick operator. See what he has done to Uncle Vose; and we haven't been
      able to worm it out of that passenger how it was done, either. Financing
      in these days comes pretty nigh to running without lights and under forced
      draught. It gets a man to Prosperity Landing in a hurry, providing he
      doesn't hit anything bigger than he is. They're going to haul up this
      freighter and blame it on to me because I ain't making money for the
      owners. They'll have plenty of figgers to show it. Look out that they
      don't lay something worse and bigger to you. They're going to play a game
      with the Vose line, I tell you! In the game of big finance, 'tag-gool,'
      making 'it' out of the little chap who can't run very fast, seems to be
      almighty popular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slowed the freighter to a snail's pace when he approached the dredged
      channel, and at last the leadsman found suitable bottom. Both anchors were
      let go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old skipper sounded the jingle, telling the chief engineer that the
      engine-crew was released. In a speaking-tube the captain ordered both
      boilers to be blown off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there's the end of me as master of my ship,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mate Mayo's eyes were wet, but words of sympathy to fit the case did not
      come to his sailor tongue, and he was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the tug was near Newport News, Manager Fogg took David Boyne apart
      from all ears which might hear. He gave the young man another packet of
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rest of your expenses for a good trip,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You seem to be a
      chap who knows how to mind his own business&mdash;and able to get at the
      other fellow's business in pretty fair shape. You haven't told such an
      awful lot about young Mayo, but it's satisfactory to learn that he has
      lived such a simple and every-day life that there isn't much to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw a man so sort of guileless,&rdquo; affirmed Boyne. &ldquo;Not that I have
      had a lot of experience, but in a lawyer's office you are bound to see
      considerable of human nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is no doubt a very deserving young man&mdash;and I'm glad I can use
      him,&rdquo; said Fogg, not able to keep all the grimness out of his tones. &ldquo;Now,
      son,&rdquo; he went on, after a moment of pondering, &ldquo;you stay on board this tug
      till I have been gone five minutes. There are a lot of sharp eyes around
      in these times, and some of Vose's friends would be glad to run to him
      with a story about me. After five minutes, you take your bag and walk to
      Dock Seven and go aboard the freighter <i>Ariel</i>&mdash;go just as if
      you belonged there. Tell the captain that you are Daniel Boyle&mdash;get
      the name&mdash;Daniel Boyle. And never tell anybody until you hear from me
      that your name is David Boyne. That freighter leaves to-night for Barbados
      with sugar machinery. You'll have a nice trip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care how far away I get,&rdquo; declared Boyne, rather bitterly. &ldquo;I
      have done a tough trick. I'm pretty much of a renegade. No, I don't care
      how far I go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I, either,&rdquo; agreed Fogg, but a smile relieved the brutality of the
      speech. &ldquo;You see, son, both of us have special reasons why it's just as
      well for you to be away from these diggings for a time. If some folks get
      hold of you they'll bother you with a lot of foolish questions. When you
      get tired of Barbados go ahead and pick out another nice trip, and keep
      going, and later on we'll find a good job for you up this way. Keep me
      posted. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tug had docked and he hurried off and away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's quite a game,&rdquo; reflected Mr. Fogg. &ldquo;I've bluffed a pot with one
      two-spot. Work was a little coarse because it had to be done on short
      notice. The work I do with my second two-spot is going to be smoother, and
      there won't be so much beefing after the pot is raked in. Too much
      hollering, and your game gets raided! I can see what would happen to me&mdash;Julius
      Marston doing it&mdash;if I give the strong-arm squad an opening. But if
      they see the little Fogg boy slip a card in the next deal he's going to
      make&mdash;well, I'll eat the <i>Montana</i>, if that's the only way to
      get rid of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boyd Mayo lost no time in obeying his orders to report in New York. He
      gave his name to a clerk at the offices of the Vose line and asked to see
      Mr. Fogg. He presented himself a bit timorously. He was not at all sure of
      his good fortune. It is rather bewildering for a young man to have the
      captaincy of a twin-screw passenger racer popped at one as carelessly as
      tossing a peanut to a child. He crushed his cap between trembling palms
      when he followed the clerk into the inner office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg rose and greeted Mayo with great cordiality. &ldquo;Good morning,
      captain,&rdquo; said the manager. &ldquo;Allow me to hope that you're going to be as
      lively in keeping to schedule time as you have been in getting here from
      Norfolk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't feel like wasting much time, considering what was promised me,&rdquo;
       stammered Mayo, not yet sure of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid I might change my mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seemed too good to be true. I wanted to get here as soon as I could
      and make sure that I had heard right, sir. Here are my papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid them in the manager's hand. Fogg did not unfold them. He fanned
      them, indicating a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Captain Mayo. You understand that new management has taken hold
      of the Vose line in order to get some life and snap into the business. We
      have strong competition. A big syndicate is taking over the other
      steamship properties, and we must hustle to keep up with the procession.
      I'm laying off freighters that are not showing a proper profit&mdash;I'm
      weeding out the moss-covered captains who are not up with the times.
      That's why I'm putting you on the <i>Montana</i> in place of Jacobs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a good man&mdash;one of the best,&rdquo; ventured Mayo, loyalty to his
      kind prompting him. &ldquo;I'll be sorry to see him step aside, as glad as I am
      to be promoted&mdash;and that's honest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the way to talk; but we've got to have hustle and dash, and young
      men can give us what we're after. It doesn't mean that you've got to take
      reckless chances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not, Mr. Fogg. My training with Captain Wass has been the other
      way. And if you could only give him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain, you've got your own row to hoe. Keep your eye on it,&rdquo; advised
      the general manager, sharply. &ldquo;I'm picking captains for the Vose boats,
      and I think I understand my business. Now what I want to know is, do you
      have confidence in me? Are you going to be loyal to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; affirmed Mayo, impressed by his superior's brisk, brusque
      business demeanor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly! And the only talk I want you to turn loose is to the effect that
      you believe I'm doing my best to make this line worth something to the
      stockholders. Where are you stopping?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo named a little hotel around the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll put you aboard the <i>Montana</i> just as soon as I can arrange the
      details of transfer. I may let Jacobs make another trip or so. Report here
      each morning at nine. For the rest of the time keep within reach of the
      hotel telephone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo saluted and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fogg called the observer at the weather bureau on the telephone and asked
      some questions. He was informed that the wind had swung into the northwest
      and that the long-prevailing fog had been blown off the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg appeared to feel somewhat peevish over this sudden departure of
      the weather phenomenon which bore his family name. He slammed the receiver
      on to the hook and said a naughty word. A person overhearing might have
      wondered a bit, for here was a steamboat manager cursing the absence of
      the fog instead of preserving his profanity to expend on the presence of
      the demoralizing mists. But the reign of the north wind in late summer is
      never long; three days later the breeze shifted, and the gray banks of the
      fog marched in from the open sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo was awakened early by the clamor of the whistles of river craft, for
      the little hotel was near the water-front. He saw the fog drifting in
      shredded masses against the high buildings, shrouding the towers. He had
      been waiting his call to duty with much impatience, finding the
      confinement of the hotel irksome in the crisp days of sunlight, eager to
      be out and about this splendid new duty which promised so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the <i>Montana's</i> sailing-day from the New York end.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had gone to sleep thrilling with the earnest hope that he would be
      called to take her out. But when he looked out into that morning, saw the
      draping curtains of the stalking mists, heard the frantic squallings of
      craft in the harbor, frenzied howls of alarm, hoarse hootings of protests
      and warnings, he was suddenly and pointedy anxious to have his elevation
      to the pilot-house of the <i>Montana</i> deferred. Better the smoky,
      cramped office of the little hotel where he had been chafing in dismal
      waiting. He was perfectly willing to sit there and study over again the
      advertising chromos on the walls and gaze out on the everlasting
      procession of rumbling drays. But at eight o'clock the telephone summoned
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is General-Manager Fogg,&rdquo; the voice informed him, though he did not
      require the information; he knew those crisp tones. &ldquo;I am speaking from my
      apartments. Please proceed at once to the <i>Montana</i>. I'll come aboard
      within an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you expect me to take command&mdash;to&mdash;take her out to-day?&rdquo;
       faltered Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Captain Jacobs will transfer command as soon as I get down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo had just been rejoicing in his heart because Jacobs would be obliged
      to bear the responsibility of that day's sailing; he had been perfectly
      sure that a new man would not be summoned under the conditions which
      prevailed. He wanted to suggest to Manager Fogg that making the change
      just then would be inadvisable. He cleared his throat and searched his
      soul for words. But a sharp and decisive click told him that Mr. Fogg
      considered the matter settled. He came away from the telephone, dizzy and
      troubled, and he was not comforted when he recollected how Manager Fogg
      had received meek suggestions in the past. He paid his modest account,
      took his traveling-bag, and started for the Vose line pier.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he saw her looming in the fog&mdash;his ship at last&mdash;he felt
      like running away from her incontinently, instead of running toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo had all of a young man's zeal and ambition and courage&mdash;but he
      had in full measure a sailor's caution and knowledge of conditions; he had
      been trained by that master of caution, Captain Zoradus Wass. He was
      really frightened as he stared up at the towering bow, the mighty flanks,
      the graceful sweep of superstructure, and realized that he must guide this
      giant and her freightage of human beings into the white void of the fog.
      In his honesty he acknowledged to himself that he was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole great fabric fairly shouted responsibility at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was confident of his ability. As chief mate he had mastered the
      problems of courses and manoeuvers in the fog along that same route which
      he must now take. But until then the supreme responsibility had devolved
      upon another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men were rushing freight aboard on rattling trucks&mdash;parallel lines of
      stevedores were working. There were many trunks, avant couriers of the
      passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went aboard by the freight entrance and found his way to the row of
      officers' staterooms. He recognized the gray-bearded veteran who was
      pacing the alley outside the pilot-house, though the man was not in
      uniform; it was the deposed master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Captain Mayo,&rdquo; he said, without any resentment in his
      tones. &ldquo;I congratulate you on your promotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you understand that I didn't go hunting for this job,&rdquo; blurted
      Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it's merely a matter of new policy&mdash;so Manager Fogg tells
      me. Understand me, too, Captain Mayo! I harbor no resentment, especially
      not against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put out his hand in fine, manly fashion, and was so distinctly the best
      type of the dignified, self-possessed sea-captain of the old school, that
      Mayo fairly flinched at thought of replacing this man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jacobs opened the door lettered &ldquo;Captain.&rdquo; &ldquo;All my truck is out
      and over the rail. I'll sit in with you, if you don't mind, until Mr. Fogg
      arrives. You're going to have a thick passage, Captain Mayo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't seem right to me&mdash;putting a new man on here in this fog,&rdquo;
       protested Mayo, warmly. &ldquo;I ought to have her in clear weather till I know
      her tricks. In a pinch, when you've got to know how a boat behaves, and
      know it mighty sudden in order to avoid a smash, one false move puts you
      into the hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seem to be running steamboat lines from Wall Street nowadays,
      instead of from the water-front,&rdquo; said Captain Jacobs, dryly. &ldquo;It's all in
      the game as they're playing it in these times. There's nothing to be said
      by the men in the pilot-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a sailor, and a simple one. I think I know my job, Captain Jacobs, or
      else I wouldn't accept this promotion. But I've got no swelled head. It's
      the proper and sensible thing for you to take the <i>Montana</i> out
      tonight and let me hang around the pilot-house and watch you. If I can
      prevail upon Mr. Fogg to allow it, will you make another trip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would do it to help you, but I'll be blasted if I'll help Fogg&mdash;not
      if he would get down now and beg me,&rdquo; declared Captain Jacobs, showing
      temper for the first time. &ldquo;And if you had been pitchforked out as I've
      been after all my years of honest service you'd feel just as I do, Captain
      Mayo. You don't blame me, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't blame you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the courses, and you'll have the same staff as I've had. You'll
      find every notation in the log accurate to the yard or the second. She's a
      steady old girl and, knowing tide set and courses, as you do, you can
      depend on her to the turn of a screw. You have my best wishes&mdash;but
      I'm done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put the fervor of final resolve into the declaration. But, with
      sailor's fraternal spirit of helpfulness he sat down and went into the
      details of all the Montana's few whims. He called in the mates and
      introduced them to the new master. They seemed to be quiet, sturdy men who
      bore no malice because a new policy had put a new man over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then arrived General-Manager Fogg, and in this strictly business presence
      Mayo did not presume to voice any of his doubts or his opinion of his
      inefficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rather stiff and decidedly painful ceremony of speeding the former
      commander was soon over, and Captain Jacobs departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why haven't you put on your uniform?&rdquo; asked Fogg. &ldquo;You have fixed
      yourself out with a new one, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Mayo's cheeks flushed slightly when he recollected how he had
      strutted before the mirror in his room at the hotel. But he had been
      ashamed to hurry into his gilt-incrusted coat in the presence of Captain
      Jacobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get it on as soon as you can,&rdquo; ordered the general manager. &ldquo;I want you
      to make a general inspection of the boat with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They made the tour, and in spite of his misgivings, when he saw the mists
      sweeping past the end of the pier Captain Mayo, receiving the salutes of
      respectful subalterns, felt the proud joy of one who has at last arrived
      at the goal of his ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master of the crack <i>Montana</i>, queen of the Vose fleet, at the age of
      twenty-six!
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced into each of the splendid mirrors of the great saloon to make
      sure of the gold letters on his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thick carpet seemed grateful to his step. The ship's orchestra was
      rehearsing in its gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      If only that devilish fog would lift! But still it surged in from the sea,
      and the glass, down to 29.40, promised no clearing weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safety to the minutest detail&mdash;that's my motto,&rdquo; declared Manager
      Fogg. &ldquo;Order a fire drill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was accomplished, and Mr. Fogg criticized the lack of snap. He was
      rather severe after the life-boat drill, was over. He ordered a second
      rehearsal. He commanded that the crew do it a third time. The warmth of
      his insistence on this feature of shipboard discipline was very
      noticeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when you put those boats back see to it that every line is free and
      coiled and every cover loose. It costs a lot of good money if you kill off
      passengers in these days.&rdquo; Then he hurried away. &ldquo;I'll see you before
      sailing-time,&rdquo; he informed Captain Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new skipper was glad to be alone and to have leisure for study of the
      steamer's log-books. He had been accustomed to a freighter's slower time
      on the courses. He did a little figuring. He found that at seventy-five
      revolutions per minute the <i>Montana</i> would log off about the same
      speed that the freighter made when doing her best. He resolved to make the
      fog an excuse and slow down to the <i>Nequasset's</i> familiar rate of
      progress. He reflected that he would feel pretty much at home under those
      circumstances. He was heartened, and went about the ship looking less like
      a malefactor doomed to execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      When General-Manager Fogg, bustled on board a few minutes prior to the
      advertised sailing-time at five o'clock, he commented on Captain Mayo's
      improved demeanor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Getting one of the best jobs on this coast seemed to make considerable of
      a mourner out of you. Perhaps a mirror has shown you how well you look in
      that new uniform. At any rate, I'm glad to see you have chirked up. And
      now I'll give you a piece of news that ought to make you look still
      happier: I'm going along on this trip with you. If you show me that you
      can do a good job in this kind of weather you needn't worry about your
      position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expression on Captain Mayo's face did not indicate unalloyed delight
      when he heard this &ldquo;good news.&rdquo; Unaccustomed as he was to the ship, he
      could not hope to make a smooth showing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And still you refuse to cheer up!&rdquo; remonstrated the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you are going along, sir. Don't misunderstand me. But a sailor
      is a pretty serious chap when he feels responsibility. I'm undertaking a
      big stunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the best way to find out whether you're the man for the job&mdash;whether
      you're the man I think you are. It's a test that beats sailing ships on a
      puddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you're aboard,&rdquo; repeated the captain. &ldquo;It's going to shade down
      my responsibility just a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, is it?&rdquo; cried Manager Fogg, his tones sharp. &ldquo;Not by a blamed
      sight! You're the captain of this craft. I'm a passenger. Don't try to
      shirk. You aren't afraid, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were standing beside the dripping rail outside the pilot-house. Far
      below them, in the spacious depths of the steamer, a bugle sounded
      long-drawn notes and the monotonous calls of stewards warned &ldquo;All ashore!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gangways were withdrawn with dull &ldquo;clackle&rdquo; of wet chains over
      pulleys, and Captain Mayo, after a swift glance at his watch, to make sure
      of the time, ordered a quartermaster to sound the signal for &ldquo;Cast off!&rdquo;
       The whistle yelped a gruff note, and, seeing that all was clear, the
      captain yanked the auxiliary bell-pulls at the rail. Two for the port
      engine, two for the starboard, and the <i>Montana</i> began to back into
      the gray pall which shrouded the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo saw the lines of faces on the pier, husbands and wives,
      mothers and sweethearts, bidding good-by to those who waved farewell from
      the steamer's decks. He gathered himself with supreme grip of resolve. It
      was up to him! He almost spoke it aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tremors of doubt did not agitate him any longer. It was unthinking faith,
      nevertheless it was implicit confidence, that all those folks placed in
      him. They were intrusting themselves to his vessel with the blind
      assurance of travelers who pursue a regular route, not caring how the
      destination is reached as long as they come to their journey's end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hoarse, long, warning blast which announced to all in the river that
      the steamer was leaving her dock drowned out the shouts of farewell and
      the strains of the gay air the orchestra was playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See you later,&rdquo; said General-Manager Fogg. &ldquo;I think I'll have an early
      dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo climbed the short ladder and entered his pilot-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was up to him!

      XX ~ TESTING OUT A MAN
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Now the first land we made is call-ed The Deadman,
     The Ramhead off Plymouth, Start, Portland and Wight.
          We sail-ed by Beachy,
          By Fairlee and Dungeness,
     Until we came abreast of the South Foreland Light.
                           &mdash;Farewell and Adieu.
</pre>
    <p>
      With starboard engine clawing her backward, and the port engine driving
      her ahead, the Montana swung her huge bulk when she was free of the
      penning piers. The churning propellers, offsetting, turned her in her
      tracks. Then she began to feel her way out of the maze of the traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grim, silent men of the pilot-houses do not talk much even when they
      are at liberty on shore. They are taciturn when on duty. They do not
      relate their sensations when they are elbowing their way through the East
      River in a fog; they haven't the language to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      A psychologist might make much out of the subject by discussing
      concentration sublimated, human senses coordinating sight and sound on the
      instant, a sort of sixth sense which must be passed on into the limbos of
      guesswork as instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in the pilot-house would not in the least understand a word of
      what the psychologist was talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steamboat officer merely understands that he must be on his job!
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Montana</i> added her voice to the bedlam of river yawp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fog was so dense that even the lookout posted at her fore windlasses
      was a hazy figure as seen from the pilot-house. A squat ferryboat, which
      was headed across the river straight at the slip where her shore gong 'was
      hailing her, splashed under the steamer's bows, two tugs loafed
      nonchalantly across in the other direction&mdash;saucy sparrows of the
      river traffic, always underfoot and dodging out of danger by a breathless
      margin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whistle-blasts piped or roared singly and in pairs, a duet of steam
      voices, or blended at times into a puzzling chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      A steamer's whistle in the fog conveys little information except to
      announce that a steam-propelled craft is somewhere yonder in the white
      blank, unseen, under way. No craft is allowed to sound passing signals
      unless the vessel she is signaling is in plain sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo could see nothing&mdash;even the surface of the water was
      almost indistinguishable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ahead, behind, to right and left, everything that could toot was busy and
      vociferous. Here and there a duet of three staccato blasts indicated that
      neighbors were threatening to collide and were crawfishing to the best of
      their ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice the big steamer stopped her engines and drifted until the squabble
      ahead of her seemed to have been settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      A halt mixes the notations of the log, but the mates of the steamer made
      the Battery signals, and after a time the spidery outlines of the first
      great bridge gave assurance that their allowances were correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Providentially there was a shredding of the fog at Hell Gate, a
      shore-breeze flicking the mists off the surface of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then was revealed the situation which lay behind the particularly emphatic
      and uproarious &ldquo;one long and two short&rdquo; blasts of a violent whistle. A
      Lehigh Valley tug was coming down the five-knot current with three light
      barges, which the drift had skeowowed until they were taking up the entire
      channel. With their cables, the tug and tow stretched for at least four
      thousand feet, almost a mile of dangerous drag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our good luck, sir,&rdquo; vouchsafed the first mate. &ldquo;She was howling so loud,
      blamed if I could tell whether she was coming or going. She's got no
      business coming down the Sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo, his teeth set hard, his rigid face dripping with moisture,
      as he stood in the open window, stopped the engines of his giant charge
      and jingled for full speed astern in order to halt her. He had no desire
      to battle for possession of the channel with what he saw ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Manager Fogg came into the pilothouse, disregarding the &ldquo;No
      Admittance&rdquo; sign by authority of his position. He lighted a cigar and
      displayed the contented air of a man who has fed fully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been making a pretty slow drag of it, haven't you, Captain Mayo?
      I've had time to eat dinner&mdash;and I'm quite a feeder at that! And we
      haven't made the Gate yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We couldn't do a stroke better and be safe,&rdquo; said the captain over his
      shoulder, his eyes on the tow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A tug and three barges in the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say you're holding up a Vose liner with eight hundred
      passengers, waiting for a tugboat? Look here, Mayo, we've got to hustle
      folks to where they want to go, and get them there in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That tow is coming down with the current and has the right of way, sir.
      And there's no chance of passing, for she's sweeping the channel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe there's any law that makes a passenger-boat hold up for
      scows,&rdquo; grumbled Fogg. &ldquo;If there is one, a good man knows how to get
      around it and keep up his schedule.&rdquo; He paced the pilot-house at the
      extreme rear, puffing his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grunted when Mayo gave the go-ahead bells and the throb of the engines
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now ram her along, boy. People in these days don't want to waste time on
      the road. They're even speeding up the automobile hearses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo did not reply. He was grateful that the dangers of Hell Gate
      had been revealed. The mists hung in wisps against North Brother Island
      when he swung into the channel of the Gate, and he could see, far ahead,
      the shaft of the lighthouse. It was a stretch where close figuring was
      needed, and this freak of the mists had given him a fine chance. He
      jingled for full speed and took a peep to note the bearing of Sunken
      Meadow spindle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothe-east, five-eighths east!&rdquo; he directed the quartermaster at the
      wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man repeated the command mechanically and brought her to her course
      for the Middle Ground passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      After they had rounded North Brother, Whitestone Point tower was revealed.
      It really seemed as if the fog were clearing, and even in the channel
      between Execution Rocks and Sands Point his hopes were rising. But in the
      wider waters off Race Rock the <i>Montana</i> drove her black snout once
      more into the white pall, and her whistle began to bray again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young captain sighed. &ldquo;East, a half nothe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;East, a half nothe, it is, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At least, he had conquered East River, the Gate, and the narrows beyond,
      and had many miles straight ahead to the whistler off Point Judith. He was
      resolved to be thankful for small favors.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hoped that with the coming of the night and on account of the
      prevalence of the fog he would find that shipping of the ordinary sort had
      stopped moving. However, in a few minutes he heard telltale whistles
      ahead, and he signaled half speed. A lumbering old lighter with a yawing
      derrick passed close aboard. An auxiliary fisherman, his exhaust snapping
      like a machine-gun, and seeming to depend on that noise for warning, was
      overtaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you leave that window for a minute, Captain Mayo?&rdquo; asked the general
      manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain promptly joined Mr. Fogg at the rear of the spacious
      pilot-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Cap,&rdquo; remonstrated his superior, &ldquo;I came down through these
      waters on the <i>Triton</i> of the Union line the other day, and she made
      her time. What's the matter with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm obeying the law, sir. And there are new warnings just issued.&rdquo; He
      pointed to the placard headed &ldquo;Safety First&rdquo; in big, red letters. &ldquo;The
      word has been passed that the first captain who is caught with the goods
      will be made an example of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; commented Fogg, studying the end of his cigar. His tone was
      a bit peculiar. &ldquo;But the <i>Triton</i> came along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she nigh rammed the <i>Nequasset</i> in the fog the last trip I made
      up the coast. It was simply touch and go, Mr. Fogg, and all her fault. We
      were following the rules to the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that's one way of spoiling the business of a steamboat line,&rdquo; snapped
      Fogg. He added, to himself, &ldquo;But it isn't my way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, but I have been trained to believe that a record for safety is
      better than all records for speed, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I let Jacobs go because he was old-fashioned, Mayo. This is the age of
      taking chances&mdash;taking chances and getting there! Business, politics,
      railroading, and steam-boating. The people expect it. The right folks do
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are general manager of this line, Mr. Fogg. Do you order me to make
      schedule time, no matter what conditions are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the captain of this boat. I simply want you to deliver up-to-date
      goods. As to how you do it, that is not my business. I'm not a
      sea-captain, and I don't presume to advise as to details.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo was young, He knew the 'longcoast game. He was ambitious.
      Opportunity had presented itself. He understood the unreasoning temper of
      those who sought dividends without bothering much about details. He knew
      how other passenger captains were making good with the powers who
      controlled transportation interests. He confessed to himself that he had
      envied the master of the rushing <i>Triton</i> who had swaggered past as
      if he owned the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till then Mayo had been the meek and apologetic passer-by along the ocean
      lane, expecting to be crowded to one side, dodging when the big fellow
      bawled for open road.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered with what haste he always manouvered the old <i>Nequasset</i>
      out of the way of harm when he heard the lordly summons of the passenger
      liners. Was not that the general method of the freighter skippers? Why
      should he not expect them to get out of his way, now that he was one of
      the swaggerers of the sea? Let them do the worrying now, as he had done
      the worrying and dodging in the past! He stepped back to his window, those
      reflections whirling in his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is no freighter,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Fogg is right. If I don't
      deliver the goods somebody else will be called on to do it, so what's the
      use? I'll play the game. Just remember&mdash;will you, Mayo&mdash;that
      you've got your heart's wish, and are captain of the <i>Montana</i>. If I
      lose this job on account of a placard with red letters, I'll kick myself
      on board a towboat, and stay there the rest of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He yanked a log-book from the rack and noted the steamer's average speed
      from the entries. He signaled to the engine-room through the
      speaking-tube.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give her two hundred a minute, chief!&rdquo; he ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And fifteen seconds later, her engines pulsing rhythmically, the big craft
      was splitting fog and water at express speed, howling for little fellows
      to get out from underfoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down in the gleaming depths of her the orchestra was lilting a gay waltz,
      silver clattered over the white napery of the dining-room, men and women
      laughed and chattered and flirted; men wrote telegrams, making
      appointments for the morrow at early hours, and the wireless flashed them
      forth. They were sent with the certainty on the part of the senders that
      no man in these days waits for tide or fog. The frothing waters flashed
      past in the night outside, and they who ventured forth upon the dripping
      decks glanced at the fan of white spume spreading into the fog, and were
      glad to return to cozy chairs and the radiance of the saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      High up forward, in the pilot-house, were the eyes and the brains of this
      rushing monster. It was dark there except for the soft, yellow gleam of
      the binnacle lights. It was silent but for the low voice of a mate who
      announced his notations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally the mates glanced at each other in the gloom when a steamer's
      whistle sounded ahead. This young captain seemed to be a chap who carried
      his nerve with him! They were used to the more cautious system of Captain
      Jacobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master did not reduce speed. He leaned far out, his hand at his ear.
      The third time an unknown sounded her blast he took a quick glance at the
      compass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two points shift&mdash;so she shows,&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;We'll pass her all
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The change in the direction of the sound had assured him. A few minutes
      later the whistle voiced a location safely abeam. But the next whistle
      they heard sounded dead ahead, and increased in volume of sound only
      gradually. They were overtaking a vessel headed in the same direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo pulled the cord oftener and sounded more prolonged, more
      imperious hoots. He ordered no change in his course. He was headed for the
      Point Judith whistler, and did not propose to take chances on fumbling by
      any detours. The craft ahead at last seemed to recognize the voice of its
      master. The sound of the whistle showed that it had swung off the course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mate mumbled notations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All ears out!&rdquo; ordered the captain. &ldquo;We ought to make that whistler!&rdquo; And
      in the next breath he said: &ldquo;There she is!&rdquo; He pointed a wet hand ahead
      and slightly to port. A queer, booming grunt came to them. &ldquo;You're all
      right, old girl,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Jacobs wasn't over-praising you.&rdquo; He
      reached over the sill and patted the woodwork of his giant pet. He turned
      to the quartermaster. &ldquo;East, five-eighths south,&rdquo; was his direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;East, five-eighths south, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the next we make, captain?&rdquo; asked the general manager from the
      gloom at the rear of the pilot-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sow and Pigs Lightship, entrance of Vineyard Sound, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good work! I'm going to take a turn below. See you again! What can I tell
      any uneasy gentleman who is afraid he'll miss a business appointment in
      the morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him we'll be on time to the dot,&rdquo; declared the captain, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg closed the pilot-house door behind himself and chuckled when he
      eased his way down the slippery ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg sauntered through the brilliantly lighted saloon, hands in his
      pockets, giving forth an impression of a man entirely at ease. Nobody
      appeared to recognize the new general manager of the Vose line, and he
      attracted no special attention. But if any one had been sufficiently
      interested in Mr. Fogg to note him closely it would have been observed
      that his mouth worked nervously when he stood at the head of the grand
      stairway and stared about him. His jowls sagged. When he pulled out his
      handkerchief his hand trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He descended the stairs to the main-deck and peered about in the
      smoking-quarters, running his eyes over the faces of the men gathered
      there. All at once he lifted his chin with a little jerk and climbed the
      stairs again. A big man tossed away a cigar and followed at a respectful
      distance. He pursued Mr. Fogg through the saloon and down a corridor and
      went into a stateroom on the general manager's heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gad, Burkett, I'm getting cold chills!&rdquo; exploded Mr. Fogg, as soon as
      the door was closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't understand just why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those people out there&mdash;I've just been looking 'em over. It's
      monkeying with too big a proposition, Burkett. You can't reckon ahead on a
      thing like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure you can. I've doped it right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know you understand what you're talking about, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I ought to know. I've been pilot for the re-survey party on the
      shoals for the last two months. I know every inch of the bottom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the panic. There's bound to be one. The rest of 'em won't understand,
      Burkett. It's going to be awful on board here. I'll be here myself. I
      can't stand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, governor; there won't be any panic. She'll slide into the sand
      like a baby nestling down into a crib. There isn't a pebble in that sand
      for miles. Half of this bunch of passengers will be abed and asleep. They
      won't wake up. The rest will never know anything special except that the
      engines have stopped. And that ain't anything unusual in a fog. It's a
      quiet night&mdash;not a ripple. Nothing to hurt us. The wireless will
      bring the revenue cutter out from Wood's Hole, and she'll stand by till
      morning and take 'em off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The theory is good. It's mostly my own idea, and I'm proud of it, and I
      was mighty glad to find a man of your experience to back me up with the
      practical details,&rdquo; said Fogg, trying to fortify his faith with words but
      failing. &ldquo;But now that it's coming down to cases I'm afraid of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's up to you, of course, governor. I insist it can be done, and
      done smooth, and you'll lay off this steamer nice, slick, and easy! That
      will put a crimp into the Vose line and make them stockholders take notice
      the next time a fair offer is made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the thing to do, and I know it. The conditions are just right, and
      we've got a green captain to make the goat of. All set! But it's an awful
      thing to monkey with&mdash;eight hundred people, and no knowing how
      they'll take it! It came over me while I stood there and looked at 'em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sand is sand, and the whole, round earth is braced up under that sand.
      She can't sink. She'll simply gouge her way like a plow into a furrow, and
      there she'll stick, sitting straight, solid as an island&mdash;and it will
      be a devil of a while before they'll be able to dig her out. It's a crimp
      for the Vose line, I say, governor!&rdquo; Malevolence glowed in Burkett's
      little eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, the money I'm getting for this job looks good to me, governor,
      but my chance to put a wallop into anything that old Vose and his sons are
      interested in looks just as good. I wouldn't be in this just for the money
      end of it. I'm no pirate, but when they kicked me out of the pilot-house
      and posted me up and down this coast, they put themselves in line to get
      what's coming to 'em from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But have you considered every side of it?&rdquo; pleaded Fogg. &ldquo;You're the
      practical man in this proposition. What can happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do exactly what I tell you to do nothing can happen but what's on
      our program. Just let me stiffen you up by running the thing over once
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled a hand-smutched, folded chart from his breast pocket and spread
      it over his knees. With blunt forefinger he indicated the points to which
      he made reference in his explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he fetches Nobska horn on his port, bearing nor'west by west, he'll
      shift his course. After about five miles he's due to shift again, swinging
      six points to nor-rard. You'll hear the mate name the bearing of West Chop
      steam-whistle. Then you walk right up to the left of the compass and stand
      there. You may hear a little tongue-clattering for a few seconds. There'll
      be a little cussing, maybe, but you won't be cussed, of course. You stand
      right there, calm and cool, never batting an eyelid. And then it will
      happen, and when it does happen it will be a surprise-party all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's wrecking a seven-thousand-ton passenger-steamer in the night!&rdquo;
       mourned the general manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't! It's putting her into a safe cradle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But at this speed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That chap in the pilot-house is no fool. He'll get his hint in time to
      save her from real damage. You needn't worry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fogg opened his traveling-bag and lifted out a strip of metal. He handled
      it as gingerly as if it were a reptile, and he looked at it with an air as
      if he feared it would bite him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the little joker,&rdquo; said Burkett. &ldquo;About two points deviation by
      local attraction will do the business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm tempted to throw it overboard and call it all off, Burkett. I have
      put through a good many deals in my life in the big game, but this looks
      almost too raw. I can't help it! I feel a hunch as if something was going
      to miscue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got no more to say, governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My crowd doesn't ask questions of me, but they expect results. If I don't
      do it, I suppose I'll kick myself in the morning.&rdquo; He cocked up his ear
      and listened to the bawling of the liner's great whistle. &ldquo;But it seems
      different in the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't leaving any tracks,&rdquo; encouraged Burkett. &ldquo;And this being his
      first run makes it more plausible. You're here all naturally, yourself. It
      might seem rather queer if you made another trip. It's his first run on
      her, I remind you. If he makes a slip-up it won't surprise the wise guys-a
      mite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to be all set&mdash;I've got to admit it. By gad, Burkett, I
      have always put a thing through when I've started on it! That's why they
      call in the little Fogg boy. I'd rather apologize to my conscience than to&mdash;Well,
      never mind who he is.&rdquo; He tucked the strip of metal into his inside coat
      pocket and buttoned the coat. &ldquo;Blast it! nothing that's very bad can
      happen in this calm sea&mdash;and that last life-boat drill went off fine.
      Here goes!&rdquo; declared Fogg, with desperate emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the boy!&rdquo; declared Burkett, encouraged to familiarity by their
      association in mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general manager found the night black when he edged his way along the
      wet deck to the pilot-house. The steamer's lights made blurred patches in
      the fog. Now she seemed to have the sea to herself; there were no
      answering whistles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm back again, Captain Mayo,&rdquo; he said, as he closed the door against the
      night. &ldquo;I hope I won't bother you folks here. I'll stay out from
      underfoot.&rdquo; He sat down on a transom at the extreme rear of the house and
      smoked his cigar with nervous vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another quartermaster succeeded the man at the wheel, the mate made his
      notations of dead reckoning and pricked the chart, the usual routine was
      proceeded with. Mayo continued at the window, head out-thrust, except when
      he glanced at chart or compass or noted the dials which marked the screws'
      revolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every now and then he put his ear to the submarine-signal receiver. At
      last he heard the faint, far throb of the Sow and Pigs submarine bell&mdash;seven
      strokes, with the four seconds' interval, then the seven strokes repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bit later he got, sweet and low as an elfland horn, the lightship's
      chime whistle. It was dead ahead, which was not exactly to his
      calculation. The tide set had served stronger than he had reckoned. He
      ordered the helmsman to ease her off a half-point, in order to make safe
      offing for the turn into Vineyard Sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well up in the sound the bell of Tarpaulin Cove reassured him, and after a
      time he heard the unmistakable blast of the great reed horn of Nobska
      uttering its triple hoot like a giant owl perched somewhere in the mists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobska,&rdquo; said the mate. &ldquo;We are certainly coming on, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobly,&rdquo; agreed Captain Mayo, allowing himself a moment of jubilation,
      even though the dreaded shoals were ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to keep this speed across the shoals, Captain Mayo?&rdquo; asked
      the general manager, displaying real deference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; stated the captain with decision, bracing himself to give Mr.
      Fogg a sharp word or two if that gentleman advanced any more of his
      &ldquo;business man's reasons&rdquo; for speed. &ldquo;It would not be showing due care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad to hear you say that,&rdquo; affirmed Mr. Fogg, heartily. &ldquo;It may be a
      little out of place, right now, but I want you to know that I feel that I
      have picked out just the right man to command this ship. I'm glad of a
      chance to say this where your mates can hear me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Fogg,&rdquo; returned the young man, gratefully. &ldquo;This is a
      soul-racking job, and I'm glad you are here to see what we are up against.
      I don't feel that we'll be wasting much time in crossing the shoals if we
      go carefully. We can let her out after we swing east of Monomoy. She's a
      grand old packet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the gloom Fogg ran his fingers gingerly over the outside of his coat to
      make sure that the strip of metal was in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence in the pilot-house after that. Ahead there was ticklish
      navigation. There were the narrow slues, the crowding shoals, the blind
      turns of Nantucket Sound, dreaded in all weathers, but a mariner's horror
      in a fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobska's clarion call drew slowly abeam to port, and after due lapse of
      time West Chop's steam-whistle lifted its guiding voice in the mists
      ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better use the pelorus and be careful about West Chop's bearing after we
      pass her, Mr. Bangs,&rdquo; Captain Mayo warned his first mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a sailor well knows, the bearing of West Chop gives the compass
      direction for passage between the shoals known as Hedge Fence and Squash
      Meadow&mdash;a ten-mile run to Cross Rip Lightship. In a fog it is vitally
      important to have West Chop exact to the eighth of a point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fogg was glad that he was alone where he sat. He trembled so violently
      that he set an unlighted cigar between his teeth to keep them from
      rattling together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mate was outlined against the window, his eyes on the instrument, his
      ear cocked. Every half-minute West Chop's whistle hooted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, sir!&rdquo; the mate reported at last, speaking briskly. &ldquo;I make it west
      by nothe, five-eighths nothe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fogg rose and half staggered forward, taking a position just to the left
      of the wheel and compass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;East by south, five-eighths south,&rdquo; the captain directed the helmsman.
      &ldquo;Careful attention, sir. Tide is flood, four knots. Make the course good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The quartermaster repeated and twirled his wheel for the usual number of
      revolutions to allow a three-points change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo stepped back and glanced at the compass to make certain that
      his helmsman was finding his course properly. &ldquo;What in tophet's name is
      the matter with you, man?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Bring this ship around! Bring her
      around!&rdquo; He grabbed the wheel and spun it. &ldquo;You're slower than the devil
      drawing molasses,&rdquo; raged Mayo, forgetting his dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must have yawed,&rdquo; protested the man. &ldquo;I had her on her course, sir. I
      supposed I had her over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not to suppose. You are to keep your eyes on that compass card
      and move quicker when I give an order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The helmsman's eyes bulged as he stared at the compass. While he had
      winked his eyes, so it seemed to him, the true course had fairly straddled
      away from the lubber line.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his frantic haste Captain Mayo put her over too far. He helped the man
      set her on the right course. Then he signaled half speed. The devious and
      the narrow paths were ahead of them..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's an almighty funny jump the old dame made then,&rdquo; pondered the
      quartermaster. But he was too well trained to argue with a captain. He
      accepted the fault as his own, and now that she was on her course, he held
      her there doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the <i>Montana's</i> half speed was a respectable gait, and the
      silent crew in her pilot-house could hear the sea lathering along her
      sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you make of that, Mr. Bangs?&rdquo; the captain asked, after a
      prolonged period of listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bell, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the only bell in that direction would be on Hedge Fence Lightship in
      case her whistle has been disabled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds to me like a vessel at anchor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's right in the fairway.&rdquo; Captain Mayo convinced himself by a
      glance at the compass. &ldquo;No craft would drop her hook in the fairway.
      That's no bell on the Hedge Fence,&rdquo; reflected the captain. &ldquo;It's a
      schooner's bell. But sound often gets freaky in a fog. We're on our course
      to the fraction, and we've got to keep going!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And after a moment the bell ceased its clangor. It was a distant sound,
      and its location was indefinite even to a sharp ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It strikes me that sounds in general are a little warded all of a
      sudden,&rdquo; said the captain to his mate. &ldquo;I'll swear that I can hear Hedge
      Fence's five-second blasts now. But there she howls off the starboard bow.
      The clouds must be giving us an echo. We've got to leave it to the
      compass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A skilful mariner is careful about forsaking the steady finger of a proved
      compass in order to chase sounds around the corner in foggy weather. He
      understands that air strata raise the dickens with whistle-blasts. There
      are zones of silence&mdash;there is divergence of sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fogg held his position, his legs braced, and nobody paid any especial
      attention to him. They in the pilothouse were too busy with other affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one sound in thick weather that tells a navigator much. It is the
      echo of his own whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big steamer was hoarsely hooting her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was a sound which fairly flew up and hit Captain Mayo in
      the face. It was an echo. It was the sound of the <i>Montana's</i>
      whistle-blast flung back at him from some object so near at hand that
      there was barely a clock-tick between whistle and echo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain yelped a great oath and yanked his bell-pulls furiously. &ldquo;That
      echo came from a schooner's sails,&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, dead ahead, clanged her bell. The next instant, plunging along at
      least eight miles an hour, in spite of engines clawing at full speed
      astern, the towering bow smashed into the obstacle in her path.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a mighty shock which sent a tremor from stem to stern of the great
      fabric. They saw that they hit her&mdash;a three-masted schooner at
      anchor, with her sails set, dingy canvas wet and idle in the foggy,
      breathless night. But their impact against her was almost as if they had
      hit a pier. The collision sent them reeling about the pilot-house. As they
      drove past they saw her go down, her stern a splintered mass of wreckage,
      in which men were frantically struggling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a granite-lugger! See her go down, like a stone!&rdquo; gasped Mate
      Bangs. &ldquo;My God! What do you suppose she has done to us forward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get there. Get there!&rdquo; roared Captain Mayo. &ldquo;Get there and report, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But before the chief mate was half-way down the ladder on his way the
      wailing voice of the lookout reported disaster. &ldquo;Hole under the water-line
      forward,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are men in the water back there, sir,&rdquo; said a quartermaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're making water fast in the forward compartment,&rdquo; came a voice through
      the speaking-tube.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already they in the pilot-house could hear the ululation of women in the
      depths of the ship, and then the husky clamor of the many voices of men
      drowned the shriller cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo had seen the survivors from the schooner struggling in the
      water. But he rang for full speed ahead and ordered the quartermaster to
      aim her into the north, knowing that land lay in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight hundred lives on my shoulders and a hole in her,&rdquo; he told himself,
      while all his world of hope and ambition seemed rocking to ruin. &ldquo;I can't
      wait to pick up those poor devils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes&mdash;in so few minutes that all his calculations as to
      his location were upset&mdash;the <i>Montana</i> plowed herself to a
      shuddering halt on a shoal, her bow lifting slightly. And when the engines
      were stopped she rested there, sturdily upright, steady as an island. But
      in her saloon the men and women who fought and screamed and cursed,
      beating to and fro in windrows of humanity like waves in a cavern, were
      convinced that the shuddering shock had signaled the doom of the vessel.
      Half-dressed men, still dizzy with sleep, confused by dreams which blended
      with the terrible reality, trampled the helpless underfoot, seeking exit
      from the saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hideous uproar which announced panic was a loud call to the master of
      the vessel. He understood what havoc might be wrought by the brutal
      senselessness of the struggle. He ran from the pilot-house, stepping on
      the feet of the general manager, who was stumbling about in bewildered
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call all the crew to stations and guard the exits,&rdquo; Captain Mayo
      commanded the second mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his precipitate way to the saloon the captain passed the room of the
      wireless operator, and the tense crackle of the spark told him that the
      SOS signal was winging its beseeching flight through the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three men, half dressed, with life-preservers buckled on in hit-or-miss
      fashion, met him on the deck, dodged his angry clutch, and leaped over the
      rail into the sea, yelling with all the power of their lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quartermaster was at the captain's heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get over a life-boat on each side and attend to those idiots!&rdquo; roared
      Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thrust his way into a crowded corridor, beating frantic men back with
      his fists, adjuring, assuring, appealing, threatening. He mounted upon a
      chair in the saloon. He fairly outbellowed the rest of them. Men of the
      sea are trained to shout against the tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are safe! Keep quiet! Sit down! This steamer is ashore on a
      sand-bank. She's as solid as Bunker Hill.&rdquo; He shouted these assurances
      over and over.
    </p>
    <p>
      They began to look at him, to pay heed to him. His uniform marked his
      identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; screamed an excited man. &ldquo;We're out to sea! We're sinking!
      Where are your life-boats?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bedlam began again. Like the fool who shouts &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; in a throng, this
      brainless individual revived all the fears of the frenzied passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo realized that heroic action was necessary. He leaped down from the
      chair, seized the man who had shouted, and beat the fellow's face with the
      flat of his hard hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      That scene of conflict was startling enough to serve as a real jolt to
      their attention. They hushed their cries; they looked on, impressed,
      cowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there's any other man in this crowd who wants to tell me I'm a liar,
      let him stand out and say so,&rdquo; shouted Captain Mayo. &ldquo;You're making fools
      of yourselves. There's no danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He released the pallid and trembling man of whom he had made an example
      and stepped on to a chair. He put up his hand, dominating them until he
      had secured absolute silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;you!&rdquo; he said, crisply, darting finger here and
      there, pointing out individuals. &ldquo;You seem to have more level heads than
      the rest, you men! Go forward where the man is casting the lead. Cast the
      lead yourselves. Come back here and report to these passengers, as their
      committee. I'm telling you the truth. There's no water under us to speak
      of.&rdquo; He remained in the saloon until his committee returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who reported looked a bit sheepish. &ldquo;The captain is right, ladies
      and gentlemen. We could even see the sand where she has plowed it up&mdash;they've
      got lanterns over the rail. There's no danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A steward trotted to Captain Mayo and handed him a slip of paper. The
      captain read the message and shook the paper in the faces of the throng.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The revenue cutter <i>Acushnet</i> has our wireless call and is starting,
      and the <i>Itasca</i> will follow. I advise you to go to bed and go to
      sleep. You're perfectly, absolutely safe. You will be transferred when
      it's daylight. Now be men and women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried out on deck. His men were hoisting aboard the three dripping,
      sputtering passengers who had run amuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And those same men would look after a runaway horse and sneer that he
      didn't have any brains,&rdquo; remarked Captain Mayo, disgustedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next half-hour he was a busy man. He investigated the <i>Montana's</i>
      wound, first of all. He found her flooded forward&mdash;her nose anchored
      into the sand with a rock-of-ages solidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart sank when he realized what her plight meant from the wrecking
      and salvage viewpoint. In those shifting sands, winnowed constantly by the
      rushing currents of the sound, digging her out might be a Gargantuan task,
      working her free a hopeless undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      His tour of investigation showed him that except for her smashed bow the
      steamer was intact. Her helplessness there in the sand was the more
      pitiable on that account.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not begun to take account of stock of his own responsibility for
      this disaster. The whirl of events had been too dizzying. As master of the
      ship he would be held to account for her mishap. But to what extent had he
      been negligent? He could not figure it out. He realized that excitement
      plays strange pranks with a man's consciousness of linked events or of the
      passage of time. He could not understand why the steamer piled up so
      quickly after the collision. According to his ample knowledge of the
      shoals, he had been on his true course and well off the dangerous
      shallows.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first mate met him amidship. &ldquo;I sent off one of our life-boats, sir.
      Told 'em to go back and hunt for the men we saw in the water. They found
      two. Others seem to be gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you thought of it, Mr. Bangs. I ought to have attended to it,
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had enough on your hands, sir, as it was. She was the <i>Lucretia M.
      Warren</i>, with granite from Vinal-haven. That's what gave us such an
      awful tunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are the men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mate and a sailor. They've had some hot drinks, and are coming along all
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have a word with them, Mr. Bangs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The survivors of the <i>Warren</i> were forward in the crew's quarters,
      and they were still dazed. They had not recovered from their fright; they
      were sullen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, men! Sailor to sailor, you know what I mean if I don't say any
      more. It's bad business on both sides. But what were you doing in the
      fairway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We wa'n't in the fairway,&rdquo; protested a grizzled man, evidently the mate.
      He was uneasy in his borrowed clothes&mdash;he had surrendered his own
      garments to a pantryman who had volunteered to dry them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have been,&rdquo; insisted Captain Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know we was all of two miles north of the regular course. I 'ain't
      sailed across these shoals for thirty years not to know soundings when I
      make 'em myself. Furthermore, she'll speak for herself, where she's sunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain could not gainsay that dictum.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mate scowled at the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got a question of my own. What ye doing, yourself, all of two miles
      out of your course, whanging along, tooting your old whistle as if you
      owned the sea and had rollers under you to go across dry ground with,
      too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not two miles out of my course,&rdquo; protested the captain, and yet the
      sickening feeling came to him that there had been some dreadful error,
      somewhere, somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they put these steamers into the hands of real men instead of having
      dudes and kids run 'em, then shipping will stand a fair show on this
      coast,&rdquo; declared the mate, casting a disparaging glance at Mayo's new
      uniform. &ldquo;It was my watch on deck, and I know what I'm talking about. You
      came belting along straight at us, two points out of your course, and I
      thought the fog was playing tricks, and I didn't believe my own ears. You
      have drowned my captain and four honest men. When I stand up in court
      they'll get the straight facts from me, I can tell you that. And they tell
      me it's your first trip. I might have knowed it was some greenhorn, when I
      heard you coming two points off your course. You'd better take off them
      clothes. I reckon you've made your <i>last</i> trip, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the querulous railing of a man who had been near death; it was the
      everlasting grouch of the sailing-man against the lordly steamboater. Mayo
      had no heart for rebuke or retort. What had happened to him, anyway? This
      old schooner man seemed to know exactly what he was talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't believe what I'm telling you, go out on deck and see if you
      can't hear the Hedge Fence whistle,&rdquo; advised the mate, sourly. &ldquo;If she
      don't bear south of east I'll eat that suit they're drying out for me. And
      that will show you that you're two miles to the norrard of where you ought
      to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On his way to the pilot-house Captain Mayo did hear the hollow voice of
      the distant whistle, with its double blast and its long interval of
      silence. The sound came from abaft his beam and his disquietude increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the acute realization was forced in upon him that he had the general
      manager of the line to face. The captain had not caught sight of his
      superior during the excitement; he wondered now why Mr. Fogg had effaced
      himself so carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red coal of a cigar glowed in a corner of the pilothouse. From that
      corner came curt inquiry: &ldquo;Well, Captain Mayo, what have you got to say
      about this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I'll do my talking after I have had daylight on the proposition,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you have any idea how you happened to be off your course so far?&rdquo;
       asked Fogg, his anxiety noticeable in his tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know I was off my course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;er&mdash;why, well, you wouldn't be aground, would you, if you
      hadn't lost your way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't lose my way, Mr. Fogg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did happen, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's for me to find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to say anything to you yet, Captain Mayo. It's too sudden&mdash;too
      big a blow. It's going to paralyze the Vose line.&rdquo; Mr. Fogg said this
      briskly, as if he were passing small talk on the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm thankful that you're taking the thing so calmly, sir. I've been
      dreading to meet you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;a business man in these days can't allow himself to fly to
      pieces over setbacks. Optimism is half the battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mayo, sitting there in that dark pilot-house for the rest of the
      night, staring out into the blank wall of the fog and surveying the wreck
      of his hopes, was decidedly not optimistic.

      XXI ~ BITTER PROOF BY MORNING LIGHT
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Bad news, bad news to our captain came
        That grieved him very sore;
     But when he knew that all of it was true,
        It grieved him ten time more,
                    Brave boys!
        It grieved him ten times more!
                     &mdash;Cold Greenland.
</pre>
    <p>
      Morning brought to him neither cheer nor counsel. The winds swept the fog
      off the seas, and the brightness of the sunshine only mocked the gloom of
      Captain Mayo's thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was most unmistakably far off his course. He took his bearings
      carefully, and he groped through his memory and his experience for reasons
      which would explain how he came to be away up there on Hedge Fence. Two of
      the masts of the sunken stone-schooner showed above the sea, two
      depressing monuments of disaster. He took further bearings and tested his
      compass with minute care. So far as he could determine it was correct to
      the dot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a busy forenoon for all on board the steamer. The revenue cutters
      took off the passengers. Representatives of the underwriters came out from
      Wood's Hole on a tug. The huge <i>Montana</i>, set solidly into its bed of
      sand, loomed against the sky, mute witness of somebody's inefficiency or
      mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the day Captain Mayo and General-Manager Fogg locked themselves in
      the captain's cabin to have it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the master had finished his statement Mr. Fogg flicked the ash from
      his cigar, studied the glowing end for a time, and narrowed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, summing it all up, it happened, and you don't know just how it
      happened. You were off your course and don't know how you happened to be
      off your course. You don't expect us to defend you before the steamboat
      inspectors, with that for an explanation, Mayo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I can do is to tell the truth at the hearing, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll break you, sure as a mule wags ears. There are five dead men
      inside that wreck yonder. Don't you reckon you'll be indicted for
      manslaughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall claim that the collision was unavoidable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you were off your course&mdash;were in a place you had no business to
      be in. That knocks your defense all to the devil. You are in almighty bad,
      Mayo. You must wake up to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man was pale and rigid and silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Vose line is in bad enough as it is, without trying to defend you. I
      suppose I'll be blamed for putting on a young captain. Mayo, I am older
      than you are and wiser about the law and such matters. Why don't you duck
      out from under, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean run away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't put it quite as bluntly as that. I mean, go away and keep out
      of sight till it quiets down. If you stay they'll put you on the rack and
      get you all tangled up by firing questions at you. And what will you gain
      by going through the muss? You've got to agree with me that the inspectors
      will suspend you&mdash;revoke your license. Here's this steamer here,
      talking for herself. If you stay around underfoot, and all the evidence is
      brought out at the hearing, then the Federal grand jury will take the
      thing up, probably. They'll have a manslaughter case against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Captain Mayo did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you simply drop out of sight I don't believe they'll chase you.
      Personally, having watched you last night, I don't believe you are guilty
      of any very bad break. It simply happened wrong. We don't want all the
      notoriety a court trial would bring to the line. And here's what I'll do,
      Mayo. I'll slip you a few hundred for expenses so that you can go away and
      grab into the shipping game somewhere else. A fellow like you can land on
      his feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fogg, a renegade steamboat man stands a mighty poor show. I may be
      suspended, and worse may happen to me, but I'm not going to ruin myself
      and my good name by running away. That's confession! It's wrecking all my
      prospects forever&mdash;and I have worked too hard for what I've got. I'm
      going to stay here and face the music&mdash;tell my story like a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will make a fine story&mdash;and you have told me yourself that they
      are just waiting to make a smashing example of somebody,&rdquo; sneered Fogg.
      &ldquo;You, a cub captain, broke the navigation rules last night by running at
      least fifteen knots in the fog. Your log and the testimony of your mates
      will show that. I'm not blaming you, son. I'm showing you how it looks!
      You got off your course and rammed a schooner at anchor, and you didn't
      even stop to pick up her men. I saw that much. Mayo, the only sensible
      thing for you to do is to duck out from under. It will save the line from
      a lot of scandal and bad advertising. By gad! if you don't do that much
      for us, after the offer I've just made you, I'll go onto the stand and
      testify against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be mighty ready and anxious to make me the goat in this
      thing,&rdquo; blazed the young man, his temper getting away from him. He had
      been without sleep for many hours, his soul had been crucified by the
      bitter experiences he had been through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you looking for a fight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Fogg, I'm looking for a square deal. I haven't done anything
      intentionally to make me a fugitive from justice. I won't run away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't be the first witness who has helped big interests by keeping
      out of sight and out of reach of the lawyers. It's business, Mayo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be, Mr. Fogg. I don't know the inside of the big deals. I'm only a
      sailor. I associate with sailors. And I've got a little pride in my good
      name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg looked at this recalcitrant with scorn. He wanted to tell this
      stubborn individual that he was merely a two-spot in the big game which
      was being played. But the expression on Mayo's face encouraged neither
      levity nor sneers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll give you a thousand dollars expense money for your trip and will
      talk job with you next year after you get your license back,&rdquo; proffered
      the general manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo fixed flaming eyes on the tempter. &ldquo;What special, private
      reason have you got for wanting to bribe me?&rdquo; demanded the young man, with
      such heat that Fogg flinched. &ldquo;You are making something very mysterious
      out of what should be open and aboveboard. That may be Wall Street
      tactics, Mr. Fogg, but it doesn't go with a sailor who has earned a
      master's papers and is proud of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, pass on then,&rdquo; directed Fogg. &ldquo;There's a tug alongside to take the
      underwriters back to Wood's Hole. Go along&mdash;to jail, or wherever it
      is you'll fetch up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall stay aboard this ship as her captain until I am relieved
      according to the formalities of the admiralty law,&rdquo; declared Captain Mayo,
      with dignity. &ldquo;I don't propose to run away from duty or punishment, Mr.
      Fogg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general manager pursed a contemptuous mouth and departed from the
      cabin. He went away on the tug without further word to Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next two days small craft buzzed about the stricken giant like
      flies around a carcass. There were insurance men, wreckers with plans and
      projects, sightseers, stockholders&mdash;and one visitor was Captain
      Zoradus Wass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing else to do just now, boy, except to come and sympathize with
      you.&rdquo; He clucked his tongue against his teeth as he looked the steamer
      over. It was condolence without words. &ldquo;Now tell me the story of it&mdash;with
      all the fine details,&rdquo; he demanded, after they were closeted in the
      captain's cabin. He sat with elbows on his knees and gazed at the floor
      during the recital, and he continued to gaze at the floor for some time
      after Mayo had ceased speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit that the quartermaster let her off for just a minute&mdash;less
      than a minute,&rdquo; repeated the young man. &ldquo;I had only just looked away for
      an instant. I helped him put her over. We couldn't have done more than cut
      a letter S for a few lengths. But the more I think of it, the queerer it
      seems. Two points off, almost in a finger-snap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell that part of it over and over again, while I shut my eyes and get it
      fixed in my mind as if I had seen it,&rdquo; requested Captain Wass. &ldquo;Who was
      there, where did they stand, and so forth and et cetry. When a thing
      happens and you can't figger it out, it's usually because you haven't
      pawed over the details carefully enough. Go ahead! I'm a good listener.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But after he had listened he had no comments to make. He went out of the
      cabin after a few minutes' wait which was devoted to deep meditation, and
      strolled about the ship, hands behind his back, scuffing his feet. A
      half-hour later, meeting Captain Mayo on his rounds, the veteran inquired:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you happen to have Oliver Burkett aboard here?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don't know
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to know him. He is the captain the Vose line fired off the <i>Nirvana</i>
      three years ago. He gave the go-ahead and a jingle when he was making
      dock, and chewed up four fishing-boats and part of the pier. He had to
      choose between admitting that he was drunk, crazy, or bribed by the
      opposition. And I guess they figured that he was all three. Was he aboard
      here the night it happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;According to my notion it's worth finding out,&rdquo; growled Captain Wass.
      &ldquo;I'm not seeing very far into this thing as yet, son, and I'll admit it.
      But if dirty work was done to you, Burkett would have been a handier tool
      for Fogg than a Stillson wrench in a plumbing job. No, don't ask me
      questions now. I haven't got any consolation for you or confidence in
      myself. I'm only thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day the wounded <i>Montana</i> was formally surrendered to the
      underwriters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Boyd Mayo was ordered to appear before the United States
      inspectors, and he went and told his story as best he could. But his best
      was an unconvincing tale, after all. He left the hearing after his
      testimony and walked down to the little hotel by the water-front to wait
      for news.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Wass came bustling down to the little hotel, plumping along at an
      extra rate of speed, setting his heels down hard, a moving monument of
      gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      His protégé, removing disconsolate gaze from the dusty chromos on the
      office walls, did not require verbal report; Captain Wass's demeanor told
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you couldn't expect much of anything else,&rdquo; declared the old man. &ldquo;I
      made the best talk I could for you after you had finished your testimony
      and had gone out. But it was no use, son! The department has been laying
      for a victim. Both of us have known that right along. They have soaked it
      to you good and proper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long am I suspended for?&rdquo; faltered Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the point! Indefinitely. You were meat. Everybody watching the
      case. They trimmed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo set his hands into his thick hair, propped his head, and stared at
      the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indefinitely doesn't mean forever, but there ain't much comfort in that.
      I'll tell you what it does mean, boy. It means that if there has been
      crooked work we've got to show it up in order to reinstate you. And now
      get a good brace on yourself. I've taken a peek in at the United States
      court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man, without lifting his head, gave the veteran a piteous
      side-glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fletcher Fogg is buzzing around the outside of that hive. He has Burkett
      along for an understrapper. They are marshaling in witnesses before the
      grand jury&mdash;those men from the <i>Warren</i>, and you know what
      they'll say, of course! Your mates and quartermasters, too! Mayo, they're
      going to railroad you to Atlanta penitentiary. They have put something
      over on you because you are young and they figured that you'd be a little
      green. It seemed queer to me when Fogg was so mighty nice to you all of a
      sudden. But they don't lay off a man like Jacobs and put in a new man just
      to be nice. They either felt they couldn't work Jacobs, or else they felt
      a green man would give 'em a good excuse for what happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they couldn't arrange to have a schooner&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was probably more than they figured on. But as long as it has
      happened they're going to use it to best advantage. You're going to have
      both tin cans tied to you, son. Every cussed bit of influence is going to
      be used against you. Poor devils on the outside, like you and I, don't
      understand just how slick the ways can be greased. Mayo, I'm going to give
      you good advice. Duck out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run away like a confessed criminal? That's the advice Fogg gave me. I
      don't think your advice is good, Captain Wass. I won't run away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may not be good advice. I ain't wise enough to know everything that's
      best. But if they put you behind the bars in Atlanta, son, you'll stay
      there till your term is up. No matter what is found out in your case, it
      will take money and a lot of time to get the truth before the right
      people. But if you ain't in prison, and we can get a line on this case and
      dig up even a part of the truth, then you've got a fighting chance in the
      open. If we can get just enough to make 'em afraid to put you onto the
      witness-stand, that much may make 'em quit their barking. You're a sailor,
      boy! You know a sailor can't do much when his hands are tied. Stay outside
      the penitentiary and help me fight this thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what to do,&rdquo; mourned the young man. &ldquo;I'm all in a whirl. I'm
      no coward, Captain Wass. I'm willing to face the music. But I'm so
      helpless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay outside jail till the fog lifts a bit in this case,&rdquo; adjured his
      mentor. &ldquo;Are you going to lie down and stick up your legs to have 'em
      tied, like a calf bound for market? Here are a few things you can do if
      you duck out of sight for a little while. I'll go ahead and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he checked himself. He was facing the window, which commanded a
      considerable section of street. He wasted no further breath on good
      advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know those men coming down there,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;They're bailiffs. I saw
      them around the court-house. They're after you, Mayo! You run! Get away!
      There must be a back door here. Scoot!&rdquo; He pulled the unresisting
      scapegoat out of his chair and hustled him to the rear of the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young man may have the best intentions. He may resolve to be a martyr,
      to bow to the law's majesty. But at that moment Mayo was receiving
      imperious command from the shipmaster whose orders he had obeyed for so
      long that obedience was second nature. And panic seized him! Men were at
      hand to arrest him. There was no time to reason the thing out. Flight is
      the first impulse of innocence persecuted. Manly resolve melted. He ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll stay behind and bluff 'em off! I'll say you're just out for a
      minute, that I'm waiting here for you,&rdquo; cried Captain Wass. &ldquo;That will
      give you a start. Try the docks. You may find one of the boys who will
      help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo escaped into a yard, dodged down an alley, planning his movements as
      he hurried, having a mariner's quickness of thought in an emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made directly for the pier where steam-vessels took water. A huge
      ocean-going tug was just getting ready to leave her berth under the
      water-hose. Her gruff whistle-call had ordered hawsers cast off. Mayo's
      'longcoast acquaintance was fairly extensive. This was a coal-barge tug,
      and he waved quick greeting to the familiar face in her pilot-house and
      leaped aboard. He climbed the forward ladder nimbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you'll have to make it hello and good-by in one breath, mate,&rdquo;
       advised the skipper. &ldquo;I'm off to take a light tow down-coast. Norfolk next
      stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her go&mdash;sooner the better,&rdquo; gasped the fugitive. &ldquo;I'll explain
      why as soon as you are out of the dock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say that you want to take the trip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got to take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The skipper cocked an eyebrow and pulled his bell. &ldquo;Make yourself to home,
      mate,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;I hope you ain't in so much of a hurry to get there as
      you seem to be, for I've got three barges to tow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo sat down on the rear transom and was hidden from all eyes on the
      pier.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no opportunity for an explanation until the barges had been
      picked up, for there was much manouver-ing and much tooting. But he found
      ready sympathy after he had explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The law sharps are always hankering to catch a poor cuss who is trying to
      navigate these waters and suit the inspectors and the owners at the same
      time,&rdquo; admitted the master of the tug. &ldquo;I have read everything the papers
      had to say about your case, and I figured they didn't give you a fair
      show. Newspapers and lawyers and owners don't understand what a fellow is
      up against. I'm glad you're aboard, mate, because I want to hear your
      side, with all the details.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The threshing over of the matter occupied many hours of the long wallow
      down the Jersey coast, and the tug captain weighed all features of the
      case with the care of a man who has plenty of time on his hands and with
      the zest a mariner displays in considering the affairs of his kind of
      folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I didn't know you pretty well, Mayo, and know what kind of a man you
      got your training with, I might think&mdash;just as those law sharps will
      probably say&mdash;that you were criminally careless or didn't know your
      business. But that dodge she made on you! Two points off her course!
      You've got to put your finger right on there and hold it! Let me tell you
      something. It was a queer thing in my own case. That was a queer thing in
      your case. Stand two queer things in our business up beside each other and
      squint at 'em and you may learn something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was on her course&mdash;I put her there with my own hands,&rdquo; persisted
      Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! You know your business. If this thing was going to be left to the
      bunch that know you, you'd go clear. But here's what happened in my case:
      I had a new man in the wheel-house, here, and he almost rammed me into
      Cuttyhunk, gave me a touch and go with the Pollock Rip Lightship, and had
      me headed toward Nauset when the fog lifted. And he was steering my
      courses to the thinness of a hair, at that! Say, I took a sudden tumble
      and frisked that chap and dragged a toad-stabber knife out of his pocket&mdash;one
      of those regular foot-long knives. It had been yawing off that compass all
      the way from a point to a point and a half. When did you shift
      wheel-watch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before we made Vineyard Sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no trouble coming up the sound?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Made Nobska and West Chop to the dot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then perhaps your general manager, who was in that pilot-house, had an
      iron gizzard inside him. Most of them Wall Street fellows do have!&rdquo; said
      the skipper, with sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's something going on in the steamboat business that I can't
      understand,&rdquo; declared Mayo. &ldquo;It's high up; it hasn't to do with us chaps,
      who have to take the kicks. Fogg brought a man aboard the old <i>Nequasset</i>,
      and he didn't bring along a good explanation to go with that man. I have
      been wondering ever since how it happened that Fogg got to be general
      manager of the Vose line so almighty sudden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them high financiers play a big game, mate. And if you happened to be a
      marked card in it, they'd tear you up and toss you under the table without
      thinking twice. If you'll take a tip from me, you lay low and do a lot of
      thinking while Uncle Zoradus does his scouting. What are you going to do
      when you get to Norfolk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the both of us better think, and think hard, mate. If the United
      States is really after you there'll be a sharp eye at every knot-hole. I
      can't afford to let 'em get in a crack at me for what I've done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll jump overboard outside the capes before I'll put you in wrong,&rdquo;
       asserted Mayo, with deep feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night the captain of the tug took a trick at the wheel in person.
    </p>
    <p>
      His guest lay on the transom, smoking the skipper's spare pipe, and
      racking his mind for ways and means. After a time he was conscious that
      the captain was growling a bit of a song to relieve the tedium of his
      task. He sang the same words over and over&mdash;a tried and true
      Chesapeake shanty:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Oh, I sailed aboard a lugger, and I shipped aboard a scow,
     And I sailed aboard a peanut-shell that had a razor bow.
     Needle in a haystack, brick into a wall!
     A nigger man in Norfolk, he ain't no 'count at all!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Mayo rolled off the transom and went to the captain's side. &ldquo;There's more
      truth than poetry in that song of yours, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have given me
      an idea. A nigger in Norfolk doesn't attract much attention. And I haven't
      got to be one of the black ones, either. Don't you suppose there's
      something aboard here I can use to stain my face with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cook is a great operator as a tattoo artist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think I want to make the disguise permanent, sir,&rdquo; stated the
      young man, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I mean is, he may have something in his kit that he can use to paint
      you with. What's your idea&mdash;stay there? I'm afraid they'll nail you.&rdquo;
       >
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll stay there just long enough to ship before the mast on a schooner.
      There isn't time to think up any better plan just now. Anything to keep
      out of sight until I can make up my mind about what's really best to be
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have that cook up here,&rdquo; offered the captain. &ldquo;He's safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cook took prompt and professional interest in the matter. &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I've got a stain that will sink in and stay put for a long time, if
      no grease paint is used. Only you mustn't wash your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no danger of a fellow having any inducement to do that when he's
      before the mast on a schooner in these days,&rdquo; declared the tug captain,
      dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, Captain Boyd Mayo, late of the crack liner <i>Montana</i>,
      was a very passable mulatto, his crisply curling hair adding to the
      disguise. He swapped his neat suit of brown with a deck-hand, and received
      some particularly unkempt garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next night, when the tug was berthed at the water station, he slipped
      off into the darkness, as homeless and as disconsolate as an abandoned
      dog.

     O Ranzo was no sailor,
     He shipped on board a whaler.
     O pity Reuben Ran-zo, Ran-zo, boys!
     O poor old Reuben Ranzo, Ranzo, boys!
                       &mdash;Reuben Ranzo.

    <p>
      Captain Mayo kept out of the region of the white lights for some time. He
      had a pretty wide acquaintance in the Virginia port, and he knew the
      beaten paths of the steamboating transients, ashore for a bit of a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lurked in alleys, feeling especially disreputable. He was not at all
      sure that his make-up was effective. His own self-consciousness convinced
      him that he was a glaring fraud, whose identity would be revealed promptly
      to any person who knew him. But while he sneaked in the purlieus of the
      city several of his 'longshore friends passed him without a second look.
      One, a second engineer on a Union line freighter, whirled after passing,
      and came back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got a job, boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We need coal-passers on the <i>Drummond</i>. She's in the stream. Come
      aboard in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was not according to Mayo's calculation, messing with steamboat
      men. &ldquo;Ah doan' conclude ah wants no sech job,&rdquo; he drawled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course you don't want to work, you blasted yaller mutt!&rdquo; snapped
      the engineer. He marched on, cursing, and Mayo was encouraged, for the man
      had given him a thorough looking-over.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out onto the wider streets. He was looking for a roving schooner
      captain, reckoning he would know one of that gentry by the cut of his jib.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ponderous man came stumping down the sidewalk, swinging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's one of 'em,&rdquo; decided Mayo. The round-crowned soft hat, undented, the
      flapping trouser legs, the gait recognized readily by one who has ever
      seen a master mariner patrol his quarter-deck&mdash;all these marked him
      as a safe man to tackle. He stopped, dragged a match against the brick
      side of a building, and relighted his cigar. But before Mayo could reach
      him a colored man hurried up and accosted the big gentleman, whipping off
      his hat and bowing with smug humility. Mayo hung up at a little distance.
      He recognized the colored man; he was one of the numerous Norfolk runners
      who furnish crews for vessels. He wore pearl-gray trousers, a tailed coat,
      and had a pink in his buttonhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah done have to say that ah doan' get that number seven man up to now,
      Cap'n Downs, though I have squitulate for him all up and down. But ah done
      expect&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Downs scowled over his scooped hands, puffing hard at his cigar.
      He threw away the match.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look-a-here! you've been chasing me two days with new stories about that
      seventh man. Haven't you known me long enough to know that you can't trim
      me for another fee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap'n Downs, you done know yo'self the present lucidateness of the
      sailorman supply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that if you don't get that man aboard my schooner to-night or the
      first thing to-morrow morning you'll never put another one aboard for me.
      You go hustle! And look here! I see you making up your mouth! Not another
      cent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colored man backed off and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo accosted the captain when that fuming gentleman came lunging along
      the sidewalk. &ldquo;Ah done lak to have that job, cap'n,&rdquo; he pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You a sailor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yas, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it you ain't hiring through the regular runners?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah doan' lak to give all my money to a dude nigger to go spotein' on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's something in that,&rdquo; acknowledged Captain Downs, softening a
      bit. &ldquo;I haven't got much use for that kind myself. You come along. But if
      you ain't A-1, shipshape, and seamanlike and come aboard my vessel to loaf
      on your job you'll wish you were in tophet with the torches lighted. Got
      any dunnage laying around anywhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I guess you're a regular sailor, all right, the way the breed
      runs nowadays. That sounds perfectly natural.&rdquo; The captain led the way
      down to a public landing, where a power-yawl, with engineer and a mate,
      was in waiting. &ldquo;Will she go into the stream to-night, Mr. Dodge?&rdquo; asked
      Captain Downs, curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir! About four hundred tons still to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Schooner captains keep religiously away from their vessels as long as the
      crafts lie at the coal-docks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up for me in the morning as soon as she is in the stream. Here's a
      man to fill the crew. If that coon shows up with another man kick the two
      of 'em up the wharf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will the passenger come aboard with you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He called me up at the hotel about supper-time and said something about
      wanting to come aboard at the dock. I tried to tell him it was foolish,
      but it's safe to reckon that a man who wants to sail as passenger from
      here to Boston on a coal-schooner is a fool, anyway. If he shows up, let
      him come aboard.&rdquo; Captain Downs swung away and the night closed in behind
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo took his place in the yawl and preserved meek and proper silence
      during the trip down the harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they swung under the counter of the schooner which was their
      destination, the young man noted that she was the <i>Drusilla M. Alden</i>,
      a five-master, of no very enviable record along the coast, so far as the
      methods and manners of her master went; Mayo had heard of her master,
      whose nickname was &ldquo;Old Mull.&rdquo; He had not recognized him under the name of
      Captain Downs when the runner had addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new member of the crew followed the mate up the ladder&mdash;only a
      few steps, for the huge schooner, with most of her cargo aboard, showed
      less than ten feet of freeboard amidships.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleepy, George?&rdquo; asked the mate, when they were on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you may as well go on this watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yass'r!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll call it now eight bells, midnight. You'll go off watch eight bells,
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo knew that the hour was not much later than eleven, but he did not
      protest; he knew something about the procedure aboard coastwise
      coal-schooners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Search-lights bent steady glare upon the chutes down which rushed the
      streams of coal, black dust swirling in the white radiance. The great
      pockets at Lambert Point are never idle. High above, on the railway,
      trains of coal-cars racketed. Under his feet the fabric of the vessel
      trembled as the chutes fed her through the three hatches. Sweating,
      coal-blackened men toiled in the depths of her, revealed below hatches by
      the electric lights, pecking at the avalanche with their shovels, trimming
      cargo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man exchanged a few listless words with the two negroes who were
      on deck, his mates of the watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were plainly not interested in him, and he avoided them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours dragged. He helped to close and batten the fore-hatch, and later
      performed similar service on the hatch aft. The main-hatch continued to
      gulp the black food which the chute fed to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a tall young man appeared to Mayo. The stranger was smartly
      dressed, and his spick-and-span garb contrasted strangely with the general
      riot of dirt aboard the schooner. He trod gingerly over the dust-coated
      planks and carried two suit-cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, George,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Take these to my stateroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going as passenger,&rdquo; said the young man, impatiently, and Mayo
      remembered what the captain had told the mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passengers on coal-schooners, sailing as friends of the master, were not
      unknown on the coast, but Mayo judged, from what he had heard, that this
      person was not a friend, and had wondered a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not allowed to go aft, sir, without orders from the mate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the mate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he is below, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo did not trouble to use his dialect on this stranger, a mere
      passenger, who spoke as if he were addressing a car-porter. The tone
      produced instant irritation, resentment in the man who had so recently
      been master of his ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passenger set down his baggage and pondered a moment. He looked Mayo
      over in calculating fashion; he stared up the wharf. Then he picked up his
      bags and hurried along the port alley and disappeared down the
      companionway.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned in a few moments, came into the waist of the vessel, and made
      careful survey of all about him. There were two sailors far forward,
      merely dim shadows. For some reason general conditions on the schooner
      seemed to satisfy the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing is breaking about right&mdash;about as I reckoned it would,&rdquo; he
      said aloud. &ldquo;Look here, George, how much talking do you do about things
      you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking to who, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to your boss&mdash;the captain&mdash;the mate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sailor before the mast is pretty careful not to say anything to a
      captain or the mates unless they speak to him first, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George, I'm not going to do anything but what is perfectly all right, you
      understand. You'll not get into any trouble over it. But what you don't
      see you can't tell, no matter if questions are asked later on. Here, take
      this!&rdquo; He crowded two silver dollars into Mayo's hands and gave him a
      push. &ldquo;You trot forward and stay there about five minutes, that's the boy!
      It's all right. It's a little of my own private business. Go ahead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo went. He reflected that it was none of his affair what a passenger
      did aboard the vessel. It was precious little interest he took in the
      craft, anyway, except as a temporary refuge. He turned away and put the
      money in his pocket, the darkness hiding his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not look toward the wharf. He strolled on past the forward house,
      where the engineer was stoking his boiler, getting up steam for the
      schooner's windlass engine. When he patrolled aft again, after a
      conscientious wait, he found the passenger leaning against the coachhouse
      door, smoking a cigarette. The electric light showed his face, and it wore
      a look of peculiar satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then some one fumbled inside the coach-house door at the stranger's
      back, and when the latter stepped away the first mate appeared, yawning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm the passenger&mdash;Mr. Bradish,&rdquo; the young man explained, promptly.
      &ldquo;I just made myself at home, put my stuff in a stateroom, and locked the
      door and took the key. Is that all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May be just as well to lock it while we're at dock and stevedores are
      aboard,&rdquo; agreed the mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How soon do we pull out of here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate yawned again and peered up into the sky, where the first gray of
      the summer dawn was showing over the cranes of the coal-pockets. &ldquo;In about
      a half-hour, I should say. Just as soon as the tug can use daylight to put
      us into the stream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The roar of the coal in the main-hatch chute had ceased. The schooner was
      loaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go strike eight bells, Jeff, and turn in!&rdquo; ordered the mate, speaking to
      Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll stay outside, here, and watch the sun rise,&rdquo; said Bradish. &ldquo;It
      will be a new experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's an almighty dirty place for loafing till we get into the stream and
      clean ship, sir. I should think taking an excursion on a coal-lugger would
      be another new experience!&rdquo; There was just a hint of grim sarcasm in his
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor ordered me to get out and away where I wouldn't hear of
      business or see business, and a friend of mine told me there were plenty
      of room and comfort aboard one of these big schooners. That cabin and the
      staterooms, they're fine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they have to give a master a good home these days. That's a Winton
      carpet in the saloon,&rdquo; declared the mate, with pride. &ldquo;And we've got a
      one-eyed cook who can certainly sling grub together. Yes, for a cheap
      vacation I dun'no' but a schooner is all right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two were getting on most amicably when Mayo went forward. He was
      dog-tired and turned in on tie bare boards of his fo'cas'le berth.
    </p>
    <p>
      No bedding is furnished men before the mast on the coal-carriers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a man wants anything between himself and the boards he must bring it
      with him, and few do so. At the end of each trip a crew is discharged and
      new men are hired, in order to save paying wages while a vessel is in port
      loading or discharging. Therefore, a coastwise schooner harbors only
      transients, for whom the fo'cas'le is merely a shelter between watches.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mayo was a sailor, and the bare boards served him better than bedding
      in which some dusky and dirty son of Ham had nestled. He laid himself down
      and slept soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second mate turned out the watch below at four bells&mdash;six in the
      morning. The schooner was in the stream and all hands were needed to work
      hose and brooms and clear off the coal-dust. Mayo toiled in the wallow of
      black water till his muscles ached.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one happy respite&mdash;they knocked off long enough to eat
      breakfast. It was sent out to them from the cook-house in one huge, metal
      pan without dishes or knives or forks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A white cook wash dishes for negroes?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo knew the custom which prevailed on board the schooners between the
      coal ports and the New England cities, and he fished for food with his
      fingers and cut meat with his jack-knife with proper meekness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was back at his scrubbing again the cook passed aft, bearing the
      zinc-lined hamper which contained the breakfast for the cabin table. That
      this cook had the complete vocabulary of others of his ilk was revealed
      when the man with the hose narrowly missed drenching the hamper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right, cook!&rdquo; roared Captain Downs, climbing ponderously on board
      from his yawl. &ldquo;Talk up to the loafing, cock-eyed, pot-colored sons of a
      coal-scuttle when I ain't here to do it. Turn away that hose, you
      mule-eared Fiji!&rdquo; He turned on Mayo, who stood at one side and was poising
      his scrubbing-broom to allow the master to pass. &ldquo;Get to work, there,
      yellow pup! Get to work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ordinarily the skipper addresses one of his sailors only through the mate.
      But there was no mate handy just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hand for the owners and one hand for yourself when you're aloft, but
      on deck it's both hands for the owners,&rdquo; he stated, as he plodded aft,
      giving forth the aphorism for the benefit of all within hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passenger was still on deck, and Mayo heard Captain Downs greet him
      rather brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the cook's hand-bell announced breakfast, and before the captain and
      his guest reappeared on deck a tug had the <i>Alden's</i> hawser and was
      towing her down the dredged channel on the way to Hampton Roads and to
      sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo went at his new tasks so handily that he passed muster as an able
      seaman. If a sailor aboard a big schooner of these days is quick, willing,
      and strong he does not need the qualities and the knowledge which made a
      man an &ldquo;A. B.&rdquo; in the old times.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the schooner was on her way behind the tug they hoisted her sails, a
      long cable called &ldquo;the messenger&rdquo; enabling the steam-winch forward to do
      all the work. Mayo was assigned to the jigger-mast, and went aloft to
      shake out the topsail. It was a dizzy height, and the task tried his
      spirit, for the sail was heavy, and he found it difficult to keep his
      balance while he was tugging at the folds of the canvas. He was obliged to
      work alone&mdash;there was only one man to a mast, and very tiny insects
      did his mates appear when Mayo glanced forward along the range of the
      masts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tug dropped them off the Tail of the Horseshoe; a smashing sou'wester
      was serving them.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all her washing set, the schooner went plowing out past the capes,
      and Mayo was given his welcome watch below; he was so sleepy that his head
      swam.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he turned out he was ordered to take his trick at the wheel. The
      schooner had made her offing and was headed for her northward run along
      the coast, which showed as a thin thread of white along the flashing blue
      of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo took the course from the gaunt, sooty Jamaican who stepped away from
      the wheel; he set his gaze on the compass and had plenty to occupy his
      hands and his mind, for a big schooner which is logging off six or eight
      knots in a following sea is somewhat of a proposition for a steersman.
      Occasionally he was obliged to climb bodily upon the wheel in order to
      hold the vessel up to her course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Downs was pacing steadily from rail to rail between the wheel and
      the house. At each turn he glanced up for a squint at the sails. It was
      the regular patrol of a schooner captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his absorption in his task, Mayo could not resist taking an
      occasional swift peep at the passenger. The young man's demeanor had
      become so peculiar that it attracted attention. He looked worried, ill at
      ease, smoked his cigarettes nervously, flung over the rail one which he
      had just lighted, and started for the captain, his mouth open. Then he
      turned away, shielded a match under the hood of the companionway, and
      touched off another cigarette. He was plainly wrestling with a problem
      that distressed him very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he hurried below. He came up almost immediately. He had the air of
      a man who had made up his mind to have a disagreeable matter over with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Downs,&rdquo; he blurted, stepping in front of Old Mull and halting
      that astonished skipper, &ldquo;will you please step down into the cabin with me
      for a few moments? I've something to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, tell it&mdash;tell it here!&rdquo; barked the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very private, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know of any privater place than this quarterdeck, fifteen miles
      offshore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the&mdash;the man at the wheel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Josephus! That ain't a man! That's a nigger sailor steering my
      schooner. Tell your tale, Mr. Bradish. Tell it right here. That fellow
      don't count any more 'n that rudder-head counts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could step down into the cabin, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My place is on this quarter-deck, sir. If you've got anything to say to
      me, say it!&rdquo; He began to pace again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradish caught step, after a scuff or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you're going to take this thing right, Captain Downs. It may sound
      queer to you at first,&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, well, tell it to me&mdash;tell it! Then I will let you know
      whether it sounds queer or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought another passenger on board with me. She is locked in a
      stateroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mull stopped his patrol with a jerk. &ldquo;She?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;You mean to
      tell me you've got a woman aboard here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're engaged&mdash;we want to get married. So she came along&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why in tophet didn't ye go get married? You don't think this is a
      parsonage, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were reasons why we couldn't get married ashore. You have to have
      licenses, and questions are asked, and we were afraid it would be found
      out before we could arrange it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is an elopement, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the young lady's father has foolish ideas about a husband for his
      daughter, and she doesn't agree with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is her father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't intend to tell you, sir. That hasn't anything to do with the
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Downs looked his passenger up and down with great disfavor. &ldquo;And
      what's your general idea in loading yourselves onto me in this fashion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the right, as captain of a ship outside the three-mile limit, to
      marry folks in an emergency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't sure that I've got any such right, and I ain't at all certain
      about the emergency, Mr. Bradish. I ain't going to stick my head into a
      scrape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there can't be any scrape for you. You simply exercise your right and
      marry us and enter it in your log and give us a paper. It will be enough
      of a marriage so that we can't be separated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to hold a hand you can bluff her father with, hey? I don't approve
      of any such tactics in matrimony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't be doing this if there were any other safe way for us,&rdquo;
       protested Bradish, earnestly. &ldquo;I'm no cheap fellow. I hold down a good
      job, sir. But the trouble is I work for her father&mdash;and you know how
      it always is in a case like that. He can't see me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rich, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; Bradish made the admission rather sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's usually the case when there's eloping done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this will not seem like eloping when it's reported right in the
      newspapers. Marriage at sea&mdash;it will seem like a romantic way of
      getting rid of the fuss of a church wedding. We'll put out a statement of
      that sort. It will give her father a chance to stop all the gossip. He'll
      be glad if you perform the ceremony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, young fellow, you're not rehearsing the stuff on me that you used on
      the girl, are you? Well, it doesn't go!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Downs, you must understand how bull-headed some rich men are in
      matters of this kind. I am active and enterprising. I'll be a handy man
      for him. He likes me in a business way&mdash;he has said so. He'll be all
      right after he gets cooled down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More rehearsal! But I ain't in love with you like that girl is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're in a terrible position, captain! Perhaps it wasn't a wise thing to
      do. But it will come out all right if you marry us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's her name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in the devil can I marry you and her if I don't know her name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven't promised that you will do your part! I don't want to
      expose this whole thing and then be turned down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't making any rash promises,&rdquo; stated Captain Downs, walking to the
      rail and taking a squint at the top-hamper. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he added, on his
      tramp past to the other rail, &ldquo;he may be an owner into this schooner
      property, for all I know. Sixteenths of her are scattered from tophet to
      Tar Hollow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't worry about his owning schooner property! He is doing quite a
      little job at putting you fellows out of business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Curiosity and something else gleamed in Captain Downs's eyes. &ldquo;Chance for
      me to rasp him, hey, by wishing you onto the family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This new idea in the situation appealed instantly to Bradish as a
      possibility to be worked. &ldquo;Promise man to man that you'll perform the
      marriage, and I'll tell you his name; then you'll be glad that you have
      promised,&rdquo; he said, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't reckon I'd try to get even with Judas I-scarrot himself by
      stealing his daughter away from him, sir. There's the girl to be
      considered in all such cases!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this isn't stealing! We're in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe, but you ain't fooling me very much, young fellow. I don't say but
      what you like her all right, but you're after something else, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man has to make his way in the world as best he can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That plan seems to be pretty fashionable among you financing fellows
      nowadays. But I'm a pretty good judge of men and you can't fool me, I say.
      Now how did you fool the girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was blunt and insulting query, but Bradish did not have the courage to
      resent it; he had too much need of placating this despot. The lover
      hesitated and glanced apprehensively at the man at the wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't mind that nigger!&rdquo; yelped Captain Downs, &ldquo;How did you ever get nigh
      enough to that girl to horn-swoggle her into this foolishness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We met at dances. We were attracted to each other,&rdquo; explained Bradish,
      meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! Yes, they tell me that girls are crazy over hoof-shaking these days,
      and I suppose it's easy to go on from there into a general state of plumb
      lunacy,&rdquo; commented Old Mull, with disgust. &ldquo;You show you ain't really in
      love with her, young man. You'd never allow her to cut up this caper if
      you were!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stuck an unlighted cigar in his mouth and continued to patrol his
      quarter-deck, muttering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradish lighted a cigarette, tossed it away after two puffs, and leaned
      against the house, studying his fingertips, scowling and sullen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo had heard all the conversation, but his interest in the identity of
      these persons was limited; New York was full of rich men, and there were
      many silly daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; suggested the captain, unamiably, &ldquo;whatever is done later,
      there's something to be done now. It's cruelty to animals to keep that
      girl shut up in that stateroom any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn't want to come out and show herself till I had had a talk with
      you, sir. I have spoken to her through the door a few times.&rdquo; He
      straightened himself and assumed dignity. &ldquo;Captain Downs, I call it to
      your attention&mdash;I want you to remember that I have observed all the
      proprieties since I have been on board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Downs snorted. &ldquo;Proprieties&mdash;poosh! You have got her into a
      nice scrape! And she's down there locked in like a cat, and probably
      starving!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn't care to eat. I think she isn't feeling very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't think she would! Go bring her up here, where she can get some
      fresh air. I'll talk to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment's hesitation Bradish went below. He returned in a little
      while.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his efforts to pretend obliviousness Mayo stared hard at the
      companionway, eager to look on the face of the girl. But she did not
      follow her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn't feel well enough to come on deck,&rdquo; reported Bradish. &ldquo;But she
      is in the saloon. Captain Downs, won't you go and talk to her and say
      something to make her feel easy in her mind? She is very nervous. She is
      frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not much of a ladies' man,&rdquo; stated Old Mull. But he pulled off his
      cap and smoothed his grizzled hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you could only say that you're going to help us!&rdquo; pleaded the
      lover. &ldquo;We throw ourselves on your mercy, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't much good as a life-raft in this love business.&rdquo; He started for
      the companionway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don't tell her that you will not marry us&mdash;not just now. Wait
      till she is calmer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I sha'n't tell her! Don't worry!&rdquo; said Captain Downs, with a grim set
      to his mouth. &ldquo;All she, or you, gets out of me can be put in a flea's
      eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He disappeared down the steps, and Bradish followed. A mate had come aft,
      obeying the master's hand-flourish, and he took up the watch. In a little
      while Mayo was relieved. He went forward, conscious that he was a bit
      irritated and disappointed because he had not seen the heroine of this
      love adventure, and wondering just a bit at his interest in that young
      lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Mayo, coiling down lines in the alley outside the
      engine-room, overheard a bulletin delivered by the one-eyed cook to the
      engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook had trotted forward, his sound eye bulging out and thus mutely
      expressing much astonishment. &ldquo;There's a dame aft. I've been making tea
      and toast for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you act as if it was the first woman you'd ever seen. What's the
      special excitement about a skirt going along as passenger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wa'n't expected to be aboard. I heard the old man talking with her.
      The flash gent that's passenger has rung her in somehow. I didn't get all
      the drift be-cause the old man only sort of purred while I was in hearing
      distance. But I caught enough to know that it ain't according to
      schedule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good looker?&rdquo; The engineer was showing a bit of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sure is!&rdquo; declared the cook, demonstrating that one eye is as handy,
      sometimes, as two. &ldquo;Peaches and cream, molasses-candy hair, hands as white
      as pastry flour. Looks good enough to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody would ever guess you are a cook, hearing you describe a girl,&rdquo;
       sneered the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a mystery about her. I heard her kind of taking on before the
      dude hushed her up. She was saying something about being sorry that she
      had come, and that she wished she was back, and that she had always done
      things on the impulse, and didn't stop to think, and so forth, and
      couldn't the ship be turned around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo forgot himself. He stopped coiling ropes and stood there and listened
      eagerly until the cook's indignant eye chanced to take a swing in his
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see who's standing there butting in on the private talk of two
      gents?&rdquo; he asked the engineer. &ldquo;Hand me that grate-poker&mdash;the hot
      one. I'll show that nigger where he belongs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mayo retreated in a hurry, knowing that he was not permitted to
      protest either by word or by look. However, the cook had given him
      something else besides an insult&mdash;he had retailed gossip which kept
      the young man's thoughts busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his rather contemptuous opinion of the wit of a girl who would
      hazard such a silly adventure, he found himself pitying her plight,
      guessing that she was really sorry. But as to what was going on in the
      master's cabin he had no way of ascertaining. He wondered whether Captain
      Downs would marry the couple in such equivocal fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, pondered Mayo, how did it happen to be any affair of his? He
      had troubles enough of his own to occupy his sole attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their spanking wind from the sou'west let go just as dusk shut down. A
      yellowish scud dimmed the stars. Mayo heard one of the mates say that the
      glass had dropped. He smelled nasty weather himself, having the sailor's
      keen instinct. The topsails were ordered in, and he climbed aloft and had
      a long, lone struggle before he got the heavy canvas folded and lashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the deck a mate commanded him to fasten the canvas covers
      over the skylights of the house. The work brought him within range of the
      conversation which Captain Downs and Bradish were carrying on, pacing the
      deck together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I don't want to throw down anybody, captain,&rdquo; Bradish was
      saying. There was an obsequious note in his voice; it was the tone of a
      man who was affecting confidential cordiality in order to get on&mdash;to
      win a favor. &ldquo;But I have a lot of sympathy for you and for the rest of the
      schooner people. I have been right there in the office, and have had a
      finger in the pie, and I've seen what has been done in a good many cases.
      Of course, you understand, this is all between us! I'm not giving away any
      of the office secrets to be used against the big fellows. But I'm willing
      to show that I'm a friend of yours. And I know you'll be a friend of mine,
      and keep mum. All is, you can get wise from what I tell you and can keep
      your eyes peeled from now on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo heard fragmentary explanation of how the combination of steamboat and
      barge interests had operated to leave only pickings to the schooners. The
      two men were tramping the deck together, and at the turns were too far
      away from him to be heard distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they're putting over the biggest job of all just now,&rdquo; proceeded
      Bradish. &ldquo;Confound it, Captain Downs, I'm not to be blamed for running
      away with a man's daughter after watching him operate as long as I have.
      His motto is, 'Go after it when you see a thing you want in this world.'
      I've been trained to that system. I've got just as much right to go after
      a thing as he. I'm treasurer of the Paramount&mdash;that's the trust with
      which they intend to smash the opposition. My job is to ask no questions
      and to sign checks when they tell me to, and Heaven only knows what kind
      of a goat it will make of me if they ever have a show-down in the courts!
      They worked some kind of a shenanigan to grab off the Vose line; I wired a
      pot of money to Fletcher Fogg, who was doing the dirty work, and it was
      paid to a clerk to work proxies at the annual meeting. And then Fogg put
      up some kind of a job on a greenhorn captain&mdash;worked a flip trick on
      the fellow and made him shove the <i>Montana</i> onto the sands. I suppose
      they'll have the Vose line at their price before I get back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo sat there in the shadow, squatting on legs which trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      This babbler&mdash;tongue loosened by his new liberty and by the
      antagonism his small nature was developing, anticipating his employer's
      enmity&mdash;had dropped a word of what Mayo knew must be the truth. It
      had been a trick&mdash;and Fletcher Fogg had worked it! Mayo did not know
      who Fletcher Fogg's employer might be. From what office this tattler came
      he did not know; but it was evident that Bradish was cognizant of the
      trick. As a result of that trick, an honest man had been ruined and
      blacklisted, deprived of opportunity to work in his profession, was a
      fugitive, a despised sailor, kicked to the Very bottom of the ladder he
      had climbed so patiently and honorably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furious passion bowled over Mayo's prudence. He leaped down from the top
      of the house and presented himself in front of the two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard it&mdash;I couldn't help hearing it!&rdquo; he stuttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's a nigger gone crazy!&rdquo; yelped Captain Downs. &ldquo;Ahoy, there, for'ard!
      Tumble aft with a rope!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm no nigger, and I'm not crazy!&rdquo; shouted Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The swinging lantern in the companionway lighted him dimly. But in the
      gloom his dusky hue was only the more accentuated. His excitement seemed
      that of a man whose wits had been touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it was a trick. But what was the trick?&rdquo; he demanded, starting
      toward Bradish, his clutching hands outspread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Downs kicked at this obstreperous sailor, and at the same time
      fanned a blow at his head with open palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo avoided both the foot and the hand. &ldquo;What does the law say about
      striking a sailor, captain? Hold on, there! I'm just as good a man as you
      are. Don't you tell those men to lay hands on me.&rdquo; He backed away from the
      sailors who came running aft, with the second mate marshaling them. He
      stripped up his sleeve and held his arm across the radiance of the
      binnacle light. &ldquo;That's a white man's skin, isn't it?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of play-acting is all this?&rdquo; asked Old Mull, with astonished
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that crisis Mayo controlled his tongue after a mighty effort to steady
      himself. He was prompted to obey his mood and announce his identity with
      all the fury that was in him. But here stood the man who had served as one
      of the tools of his enemies, whoever they were. For his weapon against
      this man Mayo had only a few words of gossip which had been dropped in an
      unwary moment; he realized his position; he regretted his passionate
      haste. He was not ready to put himself into the power of his enemies by
      telling this man who he was; he remembered that he was running away from
      the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradish gaped at this intruder without seeming to understand what it all
      meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passengers better get below out of the muss,&rdquo; advised Captain Downs.
      &ldquo;Here's a crazy nigger, mate. Grab him and tie him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo backed to the rack at the rail and pulled out two belaying-pins,
      mighty weapons, one for each hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradish hurried away into the depths of the house, manifestly glad to get
      out from underfoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you allow those niggers to lay their hands on me,&rdquo; repeated the man
      at bay. &ldquo;Captain Downs, let me have a word to you in private.&rdquo; He had
      desperately decided on making a confidant of one of his kind. He bitterly
      needed the help a master mariner could give him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get at him!&rdquo; roared the skipper. &ldquo;Go in, you niggers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the gods! you'll be short-handed, sir. I'll kill 'em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That threat was more effective than mere bluster. Captain Downs
      instinctively squinted aloft at the scud which was dimming the stars; he
      sniffed at the volleying wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word to you, and you'll understand, sir!&rdquo; pleaded Mayo. He put the
      pins back into the rack and walked straight to the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no menace in his action, and the mate did not interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a word or two to you, sir, to show you that I have done more than
      throw my hat into the door of the Masters and Mates Association.&rdquo; He
      leaned close and whispered. &ldquo;Now let me tell you something else&mdash;in
      private?&rdquo; he urged in low tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Downs glanced again at the bared arm and surveyed this sailor with
      more careful scrutiny. &ldquo;You go around and come into the for'ard cabin
      through the coach-house door,&rdquo; he commanded, after a little hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo bowed and hurried away down the lee alley.
    </p>
    <p>
      That cabin designated as the place of conference was the dining-saloon of
      the schooner. He waited there until Captain Downs, moving his bulk more
      deliberately, trudged down the main companionway and came into the
      apartment through its after-door which no sailor was allowed to profane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can anybody&mdash;in there&mdash;hear?&rdquo; asked Mayo, cautiously. He
      pointed to the main saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's in her stateroom and he's talking through the door,&rdquo; grunted the
      skipper. &ldquo;Now what's on your mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo reached his hand into an inside pocket of his shirt and drew forth a
      document. He laid it in Captain Downs's hand. The skipper sat down at the
      table, pulled out his spectacles, and adjusted them on his bulging nose in
      leisurely fashion, spread the paper on the red damask cloth, and studied
      it. He tipped down his head and stared at Mayo over the edge of his
      glasses with true astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This your name in these master's papers?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're&mdash;you claim to be the Captain Mayo who smashed the <i>Montana?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm the man, sir. I hung on to my papers, even though they have been
      canceled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know about these papers? How do I know your name is Mayo? You
      might have stolen 'em&mdash;though, for that matter, you might just as
      well carry a dynamite bomb around in your pocket, for all the good they'll
      do you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the point, sir. They merely prove my identity. Nobody else would
      want them. Captain Downs, I'm running away from the law. I own up to you.
      Let me tell you how it happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it short,&rdquo; snapped the captain, showing no great amiability toward
      this plucked and discredited master. &ldquo;The wind is breezing up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He told his story concisely and in manly fashion, standing up while
      Captain Downs sat and stared over his spectacles, drumming his stubby
      fingers on the red damask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, sir, that's why I am here and how I happened to get here,&rdquo; Mayo
      concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't prepared to say it isn't so,&rdquo; admitted Old Mull at last, &ldquo;no
      matter how foolish it sounds. And I'm wondering if next I'll find the King
      of Peruvia or the Queen of Sheba aboard this schooner. New folks are
      piling in fast! I know Captain Wass pretty well, though I never laid eye
      on you to know you. Where's that wart on his face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Starboard side of his nose, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he do, whittle off his chaw or bite the plug?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither. Chews fine cut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's his favorite line of talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reciting the pilot rules and jawing because the big fellows slam along
      without observing them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last remark showing that you have been in the pilothouse along with
      Captain Wass! Examination is over and you rank one hundred and the board
      stands adjourned!&rdquo; He rose and shook hands with Mayo. &ldquo;Now what can I do
      for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't suppose you can do much of anything, Captain Downs. But I'm going
      to ask you this, master to masted. Don't let a soul aboard this schooner
      know who I am&mdash;especially those two back there!&rdquo; He pointed to the
      door of the main saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to be more or less of a masked-ball party aboard here!&rdquo; growled the
      skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man you call Bradish, whoever he is, knows what kind of a game they
      played on me. I want to get it out of him. If he knows who I am he won't
      loosen! I was a fool to break in as I did. He was coming across to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seemed to be pretty gossipy,&rdquo; admitted the captain. &ldquo;Is trying to be my
      special chum so as to work me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you suppose you can get some more out of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel that it's sailors against the shore pirates this time, sir. Won't
      you call that man out here and ask him some questions and allow me to
      listen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under the circumstances I'll do it. Sailors first is my motto. You step
      into the mate's stateroom, there, and put ear to the crack o' the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when Bradish appeared, answering the captain's summons, all his
      chattiness had left him. He declared that he knew nothing about the
      trouble in the <i>Montana</i> case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said something about a scheme to fool a green captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only gossip&mdash;I probably got it wrong. I have thought it over
      and really can't remember where I heard it or much about it. Might have
      been just newspaper faking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kept peering about the dimly lighted room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't worry, young man. That nigger isn't here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he said he was a white man. And how does he come to be interested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a nigger gone crazy about that case&mdash;he has probably been
      reading fake stories in the papers, too,&rdquo; stated Captain Downs, grimly. &ldquo;I
      must remind you again, Bradish, that you were talking to me in pretty
      lively style.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a man lets out a lot of guesswork when he is nervous about his own
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I might fix it so that you'd be a little less nervous, providing
      you'll show a more willing disposition when I ask you a few questions,&rdquo;
       probed the skipper. But this insistence alarmed Bradish and his blinking
      eyes revealed his fears and suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know anything about the <i>Montana</i> case. I don't intend to do
      any talking about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Downs tapped harder on the table, scowled, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else, sir?&rdquo; inquired Bradish, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess not, if that's the way you feel about it!&rdquo; snapped Captain Downs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradish went back into the main saloon, and the eavesdropper ventured
      forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know just what the dickens to do about you, now that I know who
      you are,&rdquo; confessed the master, looking Mayo up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't anything to do except let me go back to my work, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm in a devil of a position. You're a captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shipped on board here before the mast, Captain Downs, and knew exactly
      what I was doing. I'll take my medicine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like to have you go for'ard there among those cattle, Mayo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Downs, it was wrong for me to make the break I did on your
      quarter-deck. I ought to have kept still; but the thing came to me so
      sudden that I went all to pieces. I'd like to step back into the crew and
      have you forget that I'm Boyd Mayo. I'll sneak ashore in Boston and lose
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain tipped up his cap and scratched the side of his head. &ldquo;Seems
      as if I remember you being at the wheel, Mayo, when that fellow was
      unloading some pretty important information on to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't help hearing, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you know he's eloping with a girl?&rdquo; The old skipper lowered his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of such a cussed, infernal performance? And I have
      talked with the girl, and she really doesn't seem to be that sort at all.
      She's flighty, you can see that. She has been left to run loose too much,
      like a lot of girls in society are running loose nowadays. They think of a
      thing that's different, and, biff! they go do it. She is wishing she
      hadn't done this. That shows some sense.&rdquo; He studied the young man. &ldquo;Do
      you know anything about this right a captain has to perform marriage
      ceremonies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing special.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will probably be a good thing for that girl to be married and settled
      down. She seems to have picked out Bradish. Mayo, you're one of my kind,
      and I want to help you. I'll take a chance on my right to perform the
      ceremony. What say if we get Bradish back in here and swap a marriage for
      what he can tell us about the <i>Montana</i> business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Downs, a fellow who will put up a job of this kind on a girl, no
      matter if she has encouraged him, is a cheap pup,&rdquo; declared Mayo, promptly
      and firmly. &ldquo;I don't want to buy back my papers in any such fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don't approve of my marrying them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't any right to tell you what you shall do, sir. I'm talking
      merely for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Downs pondered. &ldquo;If he's her father's right-hand man, he's
      probably just as good as most of the land pirates who have been courting
      her. If she goes home married, even if it is only marriage on the high
      seas, contract between willing persons with witnesses and the master of
      the vessel officiating, as I believe it's allowed, she'll have her good
      name protected, and that means a lot. I don't know as I have any right to
      stand out and block their way, seeing how far it has gone. What do you
      think, Mayo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe I want to make any suggestions, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the door aft opened. Mayo was near the door of the mate's
      stateroom in the shadows, and he dodged back into his retreat. He heard
      Bradish's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Downs, this young lady has something to say to you and I hope
      you'll listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the girl's voice! It was impetuous outburst. She hurried her words as
      if she feared to wait for second and saner reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Downs, I cannot wait any longer. You must act. I beg of you. I
      have made up my mind. I am ready!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready to get married, you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Now that my mind is made up, please hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tone was high-pitched, tears were close behind her desperation, her
      words rushed almost incoherently. But Mayo, staring sightlessly in the
      black darkness of the little stateroom, his hearing keen, knew that voice.
      He could not restrain himself. He pulled the door wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was Alma Marston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were bright, her cheeks were flushed, and it was plain that her
      impulsive nature was flaming with determination. The shadows were deep in
      the corners of the saloon, and the man in the stateroom door was not
      noticed by the three who stood there in the patch of light cast by the
      swinging lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you&mdash;I beg you&mdash;I have made up my mind! I must have it
      over with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't have hysterics! This is no thing to be rushed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're talking to a captain aboard his own vessel, ma'am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From Mayo's choking throat came some sort of sound and the girl glanced in
      his direction, but it was a hasty and indifferent gaze. Her own affairs
      were engrossing her. He reeled back into the little room, and the swing of
      the schooner shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are captain! You have the power! That's why I am talking to you,
      sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when you talked with me a little while ago you were crawfishing!&rdquo; was
      Captain Downs's blunt objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry I have been so imprudent. I ought not to be here. I have said
      so. I do too many things on impulse. Now I want to be married!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More impulse, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be able to face my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence in the saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo shoved trembling fingers into his mouth and bit upon them to keep
      back what his horrified reason warned him would be a scream of protest. In
      spite of what his eyes and ears told him, it all seemed to be some sort of
      hideous unreality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a big responsibility,&rdquo; proceeded Captain Downs, mumbling his words
      and talking half to himself in his uncertainty. &ldquo;I've been trying to get
      some light on it from another&mdash;from a man who ought to understand
      more about it than what I do. It's too much of a problem for a man to
      wrassle with all alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned his back on them, gazed at the stateroom door, tipped his cap
      awry, and scratched his head more vigorously than he had in his past
      ponderings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, you in there! Mate!&rdquo; he called, clumsily preserving Mayo's
      incognito. &ldquo;I'm in a pinch. Say what you really think!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no word from the stateroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're an unprejudiced party,&rdquo; insisted the skipper. &ldquo;You have good
      judgment. Now what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that, in there?&rdquo; demanded Bradish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should this person, whoever he is, have any-thing to say about my
      affairs?&rdquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I'm asking him to say!&rdquo; yelped the skipper, showing anger. &ldquo;I'm
      running this! Don't try to tell me my own business!&rdquo; He walked toward the
      door. &ldquo;Speak up, mate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's an insult to me&mdash;asking strangers about my private affairs!&rdquo;
       The protest of the girl was a furious outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I resent it, captain! Most bitterly resent it,&rdquo; stated Bradish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old skipper walked back toward them. &ldquo;Resent it as much as you
      condemned like, sir! You're here asking favors of me. I want to do what is
      right for all concerned. You ought to be married&mdash;I admit that. But
      what sort of a position does it leave me in? Are you going to tell me this
      girl's name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm Alma Marston!&rdquo; She volleyed the name at him with hysterical violence,
      but he did not seem to be impressed. &ldquo;I am Julius Marston's daughter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The skipper looked her up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you will be so good as to proceed about your duty!&rdquo; she commanded,
      haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can't expect me to show any special neighborly kindness to the
      Wall Street gouger who kept me tied up without a charter two months last
      spring with his steamboat combinations and his dicker deals!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are we to take that, sir?&rdquo; asked Bradish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was staring with frank wonder at this hard-shelled mariner whom
      she had not been able to impress by her name or her manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I demand an explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll give it to you, seeing that I'm perfectly willing to. Take it
      one way, and I'm willing to wallop Julius Marston by handing him the kind
      of a son-in-law you'd make; take it the other way, and I ain't particular
      about doing anything to accommodate anybody in the Marston family.&rdquo; He
      eyed them sardonically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, you see, I'm betwixt and between in the matter! It's like settling a
      question by flipping a cent. And I'll tell you what I'm going to do!&rdquo; He
      smacked his palm on the table. He strode back toward the stateroom door.
      &ldquo;Mate, ahoy, there! Sailor to sailor, now, and remember that you have
      asked something of <i>me!</i> If you were captain of this schooner would
      you marry off these two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They waited in silence, in which they heard the whummle and screech of the
      wind outside and the angry squalling of the sheathing of the plunging
      schooner's cabin walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice which replied to Captain Downs's query did not sound human. It
      was a sort of muffled wail, but there was no mistaking its positiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said the man behind the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back to the table lurched Captain Downs. He pounded down his fist. &ldquo;That
      settles it with me!&rdquo; Then he poised his big hand on the edge of the
      table-cover. &ldquo;I was ready to tip one way or the other and it needed only a
      little push. I have tipped.&rdquo; Down came the palm flat on the table-cloth
      with final and decisive firmness. &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; he informed Bradish,
      &ldquo;there's an extra stateroom, there, off this dining-saloon. You take it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I tell my father?&rdquo; wailed the girl, the fire of her
      determination suddenly quenched by sobbing helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can tell him that I temporarily adopted you as my daughter at three
      bells on this particular evening, and I'll go to him and back you up if it
      becomes necessary.&rdquo; He opened the door leading aft and bowed. &ldquo;Now, you
      trot along to your stateroom, sissy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After hesitating a few moments she hurried away. The skipper locked the
      door and slipped the key into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I'm going to&mdash;&rdquo; began Bradish, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't wasting any thoughts on you, sir. I'm saving 'em all for the <i>Drusilla
      M. Alden</i> just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The craft's plunging roll gave evidence that the sea was making. At that
      instant the first mate came down a few steps of the forward companionway,
      entering through the coach-house door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's breezing up fresh from east'ard, sir!&rdquo; he reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I've judged from the way this sheathing is talking up. I'll be on deck
      at once, Mr. Dodge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That report was a summons to a sailor; Mayo came staggering out of the
      stateroom. He looked neither to right nor left nor at either of the men in
      the saloon. He stumbled toward the companionway, reaching his hands in
      front of him after the fashion in which a man gropes in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you letting a nigger&mdash;and a crazy one at that&mdash;decide the
      biggest thing in my life?&rdquo; raged Bradish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what I'm doing,&rdquo; Captain Downs assured him. But the skipper was
      manifestly amazed by the expression he saw on Mayo's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't stand for it! Here, you!&rdquo; Bradish rushed across the room and
      intercepted Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come away from that man!&rdquo; commanded the skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bradish was not in a mood to obey authority. &ldquo;There's something behind
      this and I propose to be let in on it! Stop, you!&rdquo; He pushed Mayo back,
      but the latter's face did not change its expression of dull, blank, utter
      despair which saw not and heard not. Mayo recovered himself and came on
      again, looking into vacancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have a grudge against me, by the gods, I'll wake you up and make
      you explain it!&rdquo; shouted Bradish. He drew back his arm and drove a quick
      punch squarely against the expressionless face. The blow came with a lurch
      of the vessel and Mayo fell flat on his back. He went down as stiffly as
      he had walked, with as little effort to save himself as a store dummy
      would have made.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was another man when he came upon his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradish had awakened him!
    </p>
    <p>
      The master of the <i>Alden</i> hurried around the table, roaring oaths,
      and tried to get between them, but he was an unwieldy man on his short
      legs. Before he was in arm's-length they were at each other, dodging here
      and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradish was no shrimp of an adversary; he was taller than his antagonist,
      and handled his fists like a man who had been trained as an amateur boxer.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fought up and down the cabin, battering each other's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The indignant master threatened them with an upraised chair, tried to
      strike down their hands with it, but they were in no mood to mind a
      mediator. They fought like maddened cats, banging against the cabin walls,
      whirling in a crazy rigadoon to find an opening for their fists; Captain
      Downs was not nimble enough to catch them. Uttering awful profanity, he
      threatened to shoot both of them and rushed into the main saloon,
      unlocking the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm coming back with a gun!&rdquo; he promised. But the fight ended suddenly in
      a wrestling trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo closed in, got Bradish's right hand in a grip, and doubled the arm
      behind his adversary's back. Then he tripped the city man and laid him
      backward over the table and against its edge with a violence that brought
      a yell of pain and made Bradish limp and passive. Mayo held him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My grudge, eh? My grudge!&rdquo; the victor panted. &ldquo;Because you wouldn't tell
      me how the sneaks ruined me? No! The girl isn't here now. I'll tell you!
      It's because you stole her self-respect and her good name, and it makes
      you too dirty a dog to be her husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He picked up Bradish and threw him on the floor. When he turned he saw the
      girl's white, agonized, frightened face at the crack of the saloon door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Downs!&rdquo; she shrieked, &ldquo;that negro is killing him. He's killing
      Ralph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The victor turned his back on her and lurched around the table on his way
      out. He stroked blood from his face with his palm, and was glad that she
      had not recognized him; and yet, her failure to do so, even though he was
      such a pitiable figure of the man she had known, was one more slash of the
      whip of anguish across his raw soul. For a moment they had stood there,
      face to face, and only blank unrecognition greeted him; it made this
      horrible contretemps seem all the more unreal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo did not pause to listen to the ravings of Captain Downs, who came
      thrusting past her. Dizzy, bleeding, half blind, he rushed up the forward
      companionway and went into the black night on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mate was bawling for all hands to shorten sail, and Mayo took his
      place with the toilers, who were manning sheets and downhauls.

      XXIII ~ THE MONSTER THAT SLIPPED ITS LEASH
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     And there Captain Kirby proved a coward at last,
     And he played at bo-peep behind the mainmast,
     And there they did stand, boys, and shiver and shake,
     For fear that that terror their lives it would take.
                              &mdash;Admiral Benbow.
</pre>
    <p>
      Rain came with the wind, and the weather settled into a sullen, driving,
      summer easterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late summer regularly furnishes one of those storms to the Atlantic coast,
      a recrudescence of the wintry gales, a trial run of the elements, a sort
      of inter-equinoctial testing out so that Eurus may be sure that his
      bellows is in working condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a storm rarely gives warning ahead that it is to be severe. It seems
      to be a meteorological prank in order to catch mariners napping.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight the <i>Alden</i> was plunging into creaming seas, her five
      masts thrummed by the blast. With five thousand tons of coal weighting
      her, she wallowed like a water-soaked log.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo, who was roused from his hideous agony of soul at four bells,
      morning, to go on deck for his watch, ventured as near the engine-room
      door as he dared, for the rain was soaking his meager garments and the red
      glow from within was grateful. The ship's pump was clanking, a
      circumstance in no way alarming, because the huge schooners of the coal
      trade are racked and wrenched in rough water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second mate came to the engine-room, lugging the sounding-rod to the
      light in order to examine the smear on its freshly chalked length.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tossed it out on deck with a grunt of satisfaction. &ldquo;Nothing to hurt!&rdquo;
       he said to the engineer. &ldquo;However, I'd rather be inside the capes in this
      blow. The old skimmer ain't what she used to be. Johnson, do you know that
      this schooner is all of two feet longer when she is loaded than when she
      is light?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew she was hogged, but I didn't know it was as bad as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put the lead-line on her before she went into the coal-dock this trip,
      and I measured her again in the stream yesterday. With a cargo she just
      humps right up like a monkey bound for war. That's the way with these
      five-masters! They get such a racking they go wrong before the owners
      realize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll never build any more, and I don't suppose they want to spend much
      money on the old ones,&rdquo; suggested the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally not, when they ain't paying dividends as it is.&rdquo; He stepped to
      the weather rail and sniffed. &ldquo;I reckon the old man will be dropping the
      killick before long,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo knew something of the methods of schooner masters and was not
      surprised by the last remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the gallant old days, when it was the custom to thrash out a blow, the
      later plan of anchoring a big craft in the high seas off the Delaware
      coast, with Europe for a lee, would have been viewed with a certain amount
      of horror by a captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the modern skipper figures that there's less wear and tear if he
      anchors and rides it out. To be sure, it's no sort of a place for a
      squeamish person, aboard a loaded schooner whose mudhook clutches bottom
      while the sea flings her about, but the masters and crews of coal-luggers
      are not squeamish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo, glancing aft, saw two men coming forward slowly, stopping at regular
      intervals. The light of a lantern played upon their dripping oilskins.
      When they arrived at the break of the main-deck, near the forward house,
      he recognized Captain Downs and the first mate. The second mate stepped
      out and replied to the captain's hail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring a maul and some more wedges!&rdquo; commanded the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Drusilla</i> is getting her back up some more,&rdquo; commented the second
      mate, starting for the storeroom. &ldquo;I don't blame her much. This is no
      place for an old lady, out here to-night.&rdquo; He ordered Mayo to accompany
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments they reported to the captain, the mate carrying the
      two-headed maul and the young man bearing an armful of wedges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Downs bestowed on Mayo about the same attention he would have
      allowed to a galley cockroach. He pointed to a gap in the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;drive one in there,&rdquo; he told the mate. &ldquo;Let that nigger hold
      the wedge.&rdquo; There was rancor in his voice&mdash;baleful hostility shone in
      his snapping eyes; no captain tolerates disobedience at sea, and Mayo had
      disregarded all discipline in the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man kneeled and performed the service and followed the party
      dutifully when they moved on to the next gap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pitching schooner groaned and grunted and squalled in all her fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every angle joint was working&mdash;yawing open and closing with dull
      grindings as the vessel rolled and plunged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By goofer, she's gritting her teeth in good shape!&rdquo; commented the first
      mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ought to have been stiffened a year ago, when she first began to
      loosen and work!&rdquo; declared Captain Downs. His anxiety stirred both his
      temper and his tongue. &ldquo;I was willing to have my sixteenth into her
      assessed for repairs, but a stockholder don't have to go to sea! I wish I
      had an excursion party of owners aboard here now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When these old critters once get loose enough to play they rattle to
      pieces mighty fast,&rdquo; said the mate. &ldquo;But this is nothing specially bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find out what we've got under us,&rdquo; snapped Captain Downs. The wedges had
      been driven. &ldquo;Let this nigger carry the lead for'ard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a difficult task in the night, because the leadline had to be
      passed from the quarter-deck to the cathead outside the shrouds; the rails
      and deck were slippery. Plainly, Captain Downs was proposing to show Mayo
      &ldquo;a thing or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He let go the lead at command, and heard the man on the quarter-deck,
      catching the line when it swung into a perpendicular position, report
      twenty-five fathoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, answering the mate's bawled orders, Mayo carried the lead forward
      and dropped it, after a period of waiting, during which the schooner had
      been eased off. He was soaked to the skin, and was miserable in both body
      and mind. He had betrayed himself, he had made an enemy of the man who
      knew something which could help him; he felt a queer sense of shame and
      despair when he remembered the girl and the expression of her face. He
      tried to convince himself that he did not care what her opinion of him
      was. What happened to that love she had professed on board the <i>Olenia?</i>
      What manner of maiden was this? He did not understand!
    </p>
    <p>
      Five times he made his precarious trip with the lead, fumbling his way
      outside the rigging.
    </p>
    <p>
      In twenty fathoms Captain Downs decided to anchor, after the mate,
      &ldquo;arming&rdquo; the lead by filling its cup with grease, found that they were
      over good holding ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the <i>Alden</i> came into the wind and slowed down, slapping wet
      sails, the second mate hammered out the holding-pin of the gigantic port
      anchor, and the hawse-hole belched fathom after fathom of chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      All hands were on deck letting sails go on the run into the lazy-jacks,
      and the big schooner swung broadside to the trough of the sea. She made a
      mighty pendulum, rolling rails under, sawing the black skies with her
      towering masts.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many things which can happen aboard a schooner in that position
      when men are either slow or stupid. A big negro who was paying out the
      mizzen-peak halyards allowed his line to foul. Into the triangle of sail
      the wind volleyed, and the thirty-foot mizzen-boom, the roll of the ship
      helping, swung as far as its loosened sheets allowed. The &ldquo;traveler,&rdquo; an
      iron hoop encircling a long bar of iron fastened at both ends to the deck,
      struck sparks as a trolley pulley produces fire from a sleety wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      With splintering of wood and clanging of metal, the iron bar was wrenched
      from its deck-fastenings and began to fly to and fro across the deck at
      the end of its tether, like a giant's slung-shot. It circled, it spun, it
      flung itself afar and returned in unexpected arcs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men fled from the area which this terror dominated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boom swung until it banged the mizzen shrouds to port, and then came
      swooping back across the deck, to slam against the starboard shrouds. The
      clanging, tethered missile it bore on its end seemed to be searching for a
      victim. When the boom met the starboard shrouds in its headlong rush, the
      schooner shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free that halyard and douse the peak!&rdquo; roared the first mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sailor started, ducking low, but he ran back when the boom came across
      the deck with such a vicious swing that the iron bar fairly screamed
      through the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gawd-a-mighty! She'll bang the mast out of her!&rdquo; clamored Captain Downs.
      &ldquo;Get some men to those halyards, Mr. Dodge! Catch that boom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate ran and kicked at a sailor, shouting profane orders. He seized
      the fellow and thrust him toward the pins where the halyards were belayed.
      But at that instant the rushing boom came hurtling overhead with its
      slung-shot, and the iron banged the rail almost exactly where the fouled
      line was secured. The mate and the sailor fell flat on their faces and
      crawled back from the zone of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get some rope and noose that boom! Lassoo it!&rdquo; commanded the master,
      touching up his orders with some lurid sea oaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the men who stepped forward did so timidly and slowly, and dodged back
      when the boom threatened. The flying bar was a terrible weapon. Now it
      swung in toward the mast&mdash;now swept in wider radius. Just where it
      would next sweep the deck between the masts depended on the vagary of wave
      and wind. It was perfectly apparent that anybody who got in its path would
      meet death as instantly as a fly under a housewife's spanker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life is sweet, even if a man is black and is toiling for a dollar-a-day
      wage.
    </p>
    <p>
      And even if a man is a mate, at a higher wage and with more
      responsibility, he is inclined to think of himself before he figures on
      saving a mast and gear for a schooner's owners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a gor-rammed crew have I got aboard here?&rdquo; shrieked the
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the kind that all wind-jammers carry these days,&rdquo; said a voice at
      his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Downs whirled and found Mayo there. &ldquo;How do you dare to speak to
      me, you tin-kettle sailor?&rdquo; demanded the master. In his passion he went
      on: &ldquo;You're aboard here under false pretenses. You can't even do your
      work. You have made this vessel liable by assaulting a passenger. You're
      no good! With you aboard here I'm just the same as one man short.&rdquo; But he
      had no time to devote to this person.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away and began to revile his mates and his sailors, his voice
      rising higher each time the rampaging boom crashed from side to side. One
      or two of the backstays had parted, and it was plain that before long the
      mast would go by the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that mast comes out it's apt to smash us clear to the water-line,&rdquo;
       lamented the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can make your herd of sheep give me a hand at the right time, I'll
      show you that a tin-kettle sailor is as good as a wind-jammer swab,&rdquo; said
      Mayo, retaliating with some of the same sort of rancor that Captain Downs
      had been expending. In that crisis he was bold enough to presume on his
      identity as a master mariner. &ldquo;I'd hate to find this kind of a bunch on
      any steamboat I've ever had experience with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he ran away before the captain had time to retort. He made a slide
      across the danger zone on his back, like a runner in a ball game. This
      move brought him into a safe place between the mainmast and the mizzen.
      There was a coil of extra cable here, and he grabbed the loose end and
      deftly made a running bowline knot. He set the noose firmly upon his
      shoulders, leaped up, and caught at the hoops on the mizzenmast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See to it that the line runs free from that coil, and stand by for
      orders!&rdquo; he shouted, and though his dyed skin was dark and he wore the
      garb of the common sailor, he spoke with the unmistakable tone of the
      master mariner. The second mate ran to the line and took charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a bucking bronco, all right!&rdquo; muttered Mayo. &ldquo;But it's for the
      honor of the steamboat men! I'll show this gang!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He poised himself for a few moments on the crotch of the boom, clinging to
      the cringles of the luff&mdash;the short ropes with which the sail is
      reefed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood there, gathering himself for his desperate undertaking,
      waiting for opportunity, taking the measure of the lashing and insensate
      monster whom he had resolved to subdue, he heard Captain Downs bawl an
      impatient command:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passengers go below!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo looked aft and saw Alma Marston clinging to the spike-rack of the
      spanker mast. The coach-house lantern shone upon her white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go below!&rdquo; repeated the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is no place for a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The vessel is going to sink!&rdquo; she quavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The schooner is all right. You go below!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How bitter her fear was Mayo could not determine. But even at his distance
      he could see stubborn resolution on her countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I've got to die, I'll not die down there in a box,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I'm
      going to stay right here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Downs swore and turned his back on her. Apparently he did not care
      to come to a real clinch with this feminine mutineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great spar crashed out to the extent of its arc, and the sail volleyed
      with it, ballooning under the weight of the wind. The reef-points were no
      longer within Mayo's reach. He ran along the boom, arms outspread to
      steady himself, and was half-way to its end before the telltale surge
      under him gave warning. Then he fell upon the huge stick, rolled under it,
      and shoved arms and legs under the foot of the sail. Barely had he
      clutched the spar in fierce embrace before it began its return journey. It
      was a dizzy sweep across the deck, a breath-taking plunge.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the spar collided with the stays he felt as if arms and legs would be
      wrenched from his body. He did not venture to move or to relax his hold.
      He clung with all his strength, and nerved himself for the return journey.
      He had watched carefully, and knew something of the vagaries of the giant
      flail. When it was flung to port the wind helped to hold it there until
      the resistless surge of the schooner sent it flying wild once more. He
      knew that no mere flesh and blood could endure many of those collisions
      with the stays. He resolved to act on the next oscillation to port, in
      order that his strength might not be gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that the cable runs free!&rdquo; he screamed as he felt the stick lift for
      its swoop.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swung himself upward over the spar the moment it struck, and the
      momentum helped him. He ran again, steadying himself like a tight-wire
      acrobat. He snatched the noose from his shoulders, slipped it over the end
      of the boom, and yelled an order, with all the strength of his lungs:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull her taut!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that instant the boom started to swing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing on the end of the spar, he was outboard; the frothing sea was
      under him. He could not jump then; to leap when the boom was sweeping
      across the deck meant a skinful of broken bones; to wait till the boom
      brought up against the stays, so he realized, would invite certain
      disaster; he would either be crushed between the boom and shrouds or
      snapped far out into the ocean as a bean 'is filliped by a thumb. On the
      extreme end of the spar the leverage would be so great that he could not
      hope to cling there with arms and legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A queer flick of thought brought to Mayo the phrase, &ldquo;Between the devil
      and the deep sea.&rdquo; That flying boom was certainly the devil, and the
      foaming sea looked mighty deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her weather roll was more sluggish and Mayo had a moment to look about for
      some mode of escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the sail of &ldquo;number four&rdquo; mast sprawling loose in its lazy-jacks,
      unfurled and showing a tumbled expanse of canvas. When he was inside the
      rail, and while the boom was gathering momentum, he took his life in his
      hands and his grit between his teeth and leaped toward the sail. He made
      the jump just at the moment when the boom would give him the most help.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard Captain Downs's astonished oath when he dove over that worthy
      mariner's head, a human comet in a twenty-foot parabola.
    </p>
    <p>
      He landed in the sail on his hands and knees, yelling, even as he
      alighted: &ldquo;Catch her, boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They did it when the spar banged against the stays. They surged on the
      rope, tightened the noose, and before the vessel rolled again had made
      half a dozen turns of the free end of the cable around the nearest cleats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo scrambled down from the sail and helped them complete the work of
      securing the spar. He passed near Captain Downs when the job had been
      finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; growled the master of the <i>Alden</i>, &ldquo;what do you expect me to
      say to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I simply ask you to keep from saying something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That a steamboat man can't earn his pay aboard a wind-jammer, sir. I
      don't like to feel that I am under obligations in any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The master grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if the little thing I have done helps to square that break I made by
      licking your passenger I'll be glad of it,&rdquo; added Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't rub it in,&rdquo; said Captain Downs, carefully noting that there
      was nobody within hearing distance. &ldquo;When a man has been in a nightmare
      for twenty-four hours, like I've been, you've got to make some allowances,
      Captain Mayo. This is a terrible mixed-upmess.&rdquo; He squinted at the mizzen
      rigging where the lanterns revealed the damage. &ldquo;And by the way those
      backstays are ripped out, and seeing how that mast is wabbling, this
      schooner is liable to be about as badly mixed up as the people are on
      board of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo turned away and went back to his work. They were rigging extra stays
      for the mizzenmast. And he noted that the girl near the coach-house door
      was staring at him with a great deal of interest. But in that gloom he was
      only a moving figure among toiling men.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later the mate ordered the oil-bags to be tied to the catheads.
      The bags were huge gunny sacks stuffed with cotton waste which was
      saturated with oil.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the fact that her spanker, double-reefed, was set in order to
      hold her up to the wind, weather-vane fashion, the schooner seemed
      determined to keep her broadside to the tumbling seas. The oil slick
      helped only a little; every few moments a wave with spoondrift flying from
      it would smash across the deck, volleying tons of water between rails,
      with a sound like thunder. At these times the swirling torrent in the
      waist would reach to a man's knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo did not take his watch below. The excitement of his recent experience
      had driven away all desire for sleep, and the sheathing in the fo'c'sle
      was squawking with such infernal din that only a deaf man could have
      remained there in comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he was not uneasy in regard to the safety of the schooner. In a
      winter gale, with ice caking on her, he would have viewed their situation
      in different light. But he had frequently seen the seas breaking over the
      wallowing coal-luggers when he had passed them at anchor on the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a trip of his own along the main-deck, scrambling upon the spars
      to avoid the occasional deluge which swept her amidship. The battened
      hatches were apparently withstanding the onslaughts of the waves. He could
      feel less weight in the wind. It was apparent that the crisis of the blow
      had passed. The waves were not so savage; their crests were not breaking.
      But just then the second mate rushed past, and Mayo overheard the report
      he gave the captain, who was pacing the lee alley:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mizzenmast is getting more play, sir. I'm afraid it's raising the
      devil with the step and ke'lson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rig extra stays and try her again for water,&rdquo; ordered the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo, returning to the mizzen, found the entire crew grouped there. The
      mast was writhing and groaning in its deck collar, twisting its coat&mdash;the
      canvas covering at its foot where it entered the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dusky faces were exhibiting much concern. They had flocked where the
      ship was dealing herself a wound; the sailor sixth sense of impending
      trouble had drawn them there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four of you hustle aloft and stand ready to make fast those stays!&rdquo;
       commanded the first mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rest of you make ready tackle!&rdquo; shouted the second mate, following close
      on Mayo's heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The negroes did not stir. They mumbled among themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step lively!&rdquo; insisted the mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Scuse us, but dat mast done goin' to tumble down,&rdquo; ventured a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aloft with you, I say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the schooner slatted herself on a great roller, and the
      starboard stays snapped, one after the other, like mammoth fiddle-strings.
      The mast reeled and there was an ominous sound below the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She done put a hole into herself!&rdquo; squealed a sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the gloom their eyes were gleaming with the fires one beholds in the
      eyes of frightened cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dere she comes!&rdquo; shouted one of them. He pointed trembling finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the coamings of the fore-hatch black water was bubbling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yelping like animals, the sailors stampeded aft in a bunch, bowling over
      Mayo and the mates in their rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop 'em, captain!&rdquo; bellowed the first mate, guessing their intent. He
      rose and ran after them. But fright gave them wings for their heels. They
      scampered over the roof of the after-house, and were on the quarter-deck
      before the skipper was out of the alley. They leaped into the yawl which
      was swung at the stern davits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You renegades!&rdquo; roared the master. &ldquo;Come out of that boat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the two mates at his heels he rushed at them. They grabbed three
      struggling men by the legs and dragged them back. But the negroes wriggled
      loose, driven to frantic efforts by their panic. They threw themselves
      into the boat again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be men!&rdquo; clamored Mayo, joining the forces of discipline. &ldquo;There's a
      woman aboard here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the plea which might have affected an Anglo-Saxon did not prevail.
      Their knives were out&mdash;not for attack on their superiors, but to
      slash away the davit tackle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, boys! Throw 'em out!&rdquo; shouted the master, leading the way into
      the yawl over the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      His two mates and Mayo followed, and the engineer, freshly arrived from
      forward, leaped after them. But as fast as they tossed a man upon the
      quarter-deck he was up and in the boat again fighting for a place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throw 'em overboard!&rdquo; roared the master, venting a terrible oath. He
      knocked one of the maddened wretches into the sea. The next moment the
      captain was flat on his back, and the sailors were trampling on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the surges came riding rail-high; sometimes an especially violent
      wave washed the deck aft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following it, a chasm regularly opened under the vessel's counter, a
      swirling pit in the ocean twenty feet deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was good fortune as well as misfortune in the affair of the yawl.
      When at last it dropped it avoided the period of the chasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the efforts of the captain and his helpers the sailors
      succeeded in slashing away the davit tackle. A swelling roller came up to
      meet the boat as the last strand gave way and swept it, with its freight,
      out into the night. But as it went Mayo clutched a davit pulley and swung
      in midair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dizzy depths of the sea opened under him as he dangled there and gazed
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instant later all his attention was focused on Alma Marston, who stood
      in the companionway clutching its sides and shrieking out her fears. The
      lantern showed her to him plainly. Its radiance lighted him also. He
      called to her several times, angrily at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is that man, Bradish?&rdquo; he demanded, fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if his arms would be pulled out. He could not reach the davit
      iron from where he hung; the schooner's rail was too far away, though he
      kicked his feet in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be a fool! Stop that screaming,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Can Bradish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is sick&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;is frightened,&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out here! Pull on that rope! Swing me in, I can't hold on here much
      longer. Do you want to see me drown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came along the rail, clinging to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not that rope! The other one! Pull hard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed, fighting back her fear. The davit swung inward slowly, and he
      managed to slide his legs up over the rail and gain the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;You're quite a sailor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had been wondering what his first words to her would be. Even while he
      swung over the yawning depths of the sea the problem of his love was so
      much more engrossing than his fear of death that his thoughts were busy
      with her. He tried to speak to her with careless tone; it had been in his
      mind that he would speak and bow and walk away. But he could not move when
      she opened her eyes on him. She was as motionless as he&mdash;a silent,
      staring pallid statue of astounded fright. The rope slipped slowly from
      her relaxing fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! It's just the man you think it is,&rdquo; he informed her, curtly. &ldquo;But
      there's nothing to be said!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say something&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he checked her savagely. &ldquo;This is no place to talk over folly! It's no
      place to talk anything! There's something else to do besides talk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going to die, aren't we?&rdquo; She leaned close to him, and the
      question was hardly more than a whisper framed by her quivering lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; he answered, brutally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me tell you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can tell me nothing! Keep still!&rdquo; he shouted, and drew away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why doesn't Captain Downs come back after us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be a fool! The sea has taken them away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They exchanged looks and were silent for a little while, and the pride in
      both of them set up mutual barriers. It was an attitude which conspired
      for relief on both sides. Because there was so much to say there was
      nothing to say in that riot of the sea and of their emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't be a fool&mdash;not any more,&rdquo; she told him. There was so
      distinctly a new note in her voice that he stared at her. &ldquo;I am no
      coward,&rdquo; she said. She seemed to have mastered herself suddenly and
      singularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo's eyes expressed frank astonishment; he was telling himself again
      that he did not understand women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't blame you for thinking that I am a fool, but I am not a coward,&rdquo;
       she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; stammered the young man. &ldquo;I forgot myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is danger, isn't there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid the mast has pounded a bad hole in her. I must run forward. I
      must see if something can't be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going with you.&rdquo; She followed him when he started away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must stay aft. You can't get forward along that deck. Look at the
      waves breaking over her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going with you,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Perhaps there is something that can
      be done. Perhaps I can help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl was stubborn, and he knew there was no time for argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three times on their way forward he was obliged to hold her in the hook of
      his arm while he fought with the torrent that a wave launched upon the
      deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt regarding the desperate plight of the schooner. She was
      noticeably down by the head, and black water was swashing forward of the
      break of the main-deck. The door of the galley was open, and the one-eyed
      cook was revealed sitting within beneath a swinging lantern. He held a cat
      under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bear a hand here, cook!&rdquo; called Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man did not get off his stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bear a hand, I say! We've got to rig tackle and get this long-boat over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The schooner's spare boat was in chocks between the foremast and the main.
      Mayo noted that it was heaped full of spare cable and held the usual odds
      and ends of a clutter-box. He climbed in hastily and gave a hand to the
      girl to assist her over the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will keep you out of the swash,&rdquo; he advised her. &ldquo;Sit there in the
      stern while I toss out this truck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she did not sit down. She began to throw out such articles as her
      strength could manage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mayo hailed the cook, cursing him heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it ain't any use,&rdquo; declared the man, with resignation. &ldquo;We're
      goners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We aren't gone till we go, you infernal turtle! Come here and pitch in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain't got no heart left for anything. I never would have believed it.
      The Old Man going off and saving a lot of nigger sailors instead of me&mdash;after
      all the vittles I've fixed up for him. If that's the kind of gratitude
      there is in the world, I'm glad I'm going out of it. Me and the cat will
      go together. The cat's a friend, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo lost his temper then in earnest. All his nature was on edge in that
      crisis, and this supine surrender of an able-bodied man whose two hands
      were needed so desperately was peculiarly exasperating. He leaped out of
      the boat, ran into the galley, and gave the cook an invigorating beating
      up with the flat of his hands. The cook clutched his cat more firmly,
      braced himself on the stool, and took his punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill me if you want to,&rdquo; he invited. &ldquo;I've got to die, and it don't make
      a mite of difference how. Murder me if you're so inclined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man&mdash;man&mdash;man, what's the matter with you?&rdquo; gasped Mayo. &ldquo;We've
      got a chance! Here's a girl to save!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hain't got no business being here. Was sneaked aboard. It's no use to
      pound me. I won't lift a finger. My mind is made up. I've been deserted by
      the Old Man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You old lunatic, Captain Downs got carried away by those cowards. Wake
      up! Help me! For the love of the Lord, help me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rushing around will only take my mind off'n thoughts of the hereafter,
      and I need to do some right thinking before my end. It ain't any use to
      threaten and jaw; nothing makes any difference to me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo saw the uselessness of further appeal, and the fellow dangled as
      limply as a stuffed dummy when the young man shook him. Therefore Mayo
      gave over his efforts and hurried back to the long-boat. The spectacle of
      the girl struggling with the stuff she was jettisoning put new
      determination into him. Her amazing fortitude at the time when he had
      looked for hysterics and collapse gave him new light on the enigma of
      femininity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you tell me that Bradish is ill?&rdquo; he asked, hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in the cabin. He would not talk to me. I could not induce him to
      come on deck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have help with the tackle,&rdquo; he told her, and started aft on the
      run.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Bradish sprawled in a morris-chair which was lashed to a
      radiator. He expected hot words and more insults, but Bradish turned to
      him a face that was gray with evident terror. His jaw sagged; his eyes
      appealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is awful!&rdquo; he mourned. &ldquo;What has happened on deck? I heard the
      fighting. Where is Miss Mar-ston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is forward. There has been an accident&mdash;a bad one. We have lost
      the captain and crew. Come on. I need help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help. I'm all in!&rdquo; groaned Bradish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say you must. It's the only way to save our lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bradish rolled his head on the back of the chair, refusing. His manner,
      his sudden change from the fighting mood, astonished Mayo. The thought
      came to him that this man had been pricked to conflict by bitter grudge
      instead of by his courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Bradish, aren't you going to help me save that girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not a sailor. There's nothing I can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you've got two hands, man. I want to get a boat overboard. Hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! I wouldn't get into a small boat with these waves so high. It
      wouldn't be safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This schooner is sinking!&rdquo; shouted Mayo. He fastened a heavy clutch upon
      Bradish's shoulders. &ldquo;There's no time to argue this thing. You come
      along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hauled Bradish to his feet and propelled him to the companionway, and
      the man went without resistance. It was evident that real danger and fear
      of death had nearly paralyzed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing I can do!&rdquo; he kept bleating.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mayo hurried him forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ralph!&rdquo; cried the girl, fairly lashing him with the tone in which she
      delivered the word. &ldquo;What is the matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing I can do. It isn't safe out here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must do what this man tells you to do. He knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Bradish clung to the gunwale of the long-boat and stared out at the
      yeasty waves, blinking his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I only had a couple of men instead of these two infernal tapeworms,&rdquo;
       raged Mayo, &ldquo;I could reeve tackle and get this boat over. Wake up! Wake
      up!&rdquo; he clamored, beating his fist on Bradish's back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ralph! Be a man!&rdquo; There were anger, protest, shocked wonder in her tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Mayo saw an ominous sight and heard a boding sound. The
      fore-hatch burst open with a mighty report, forced up by the air
      compressed by the inflowing water. He wasted no more breath in argument
      and appeals. He realized that even an able crew would not have time to
      launch the boat. The schooner was near her doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all haste he pulled his clasp-knife and cut the lashings which held the
      boat in its chocks. That the craft would be driven free from the
      entangling wreckage and go afloat when the schooner went under he could
      hardly hope. But there was only this desperate chance to rely upon in the
      emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his agony of despair and his fury of resentment he was tempted to climb
      into the boat and leave the two cowards to their fate. But he stooped,
      caught Bradish by the legs and boosted him over the gunwale into the yawl.
      A sailor's impulse is to save life even at the risk of his own. Mayo ran
      to the galley and kicked the cook off the stool and then drove him
      headlong to the longboat. The man went along, hugging his cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will happen to us?&rdquo; asked the girl when Mayo climbed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;I reckon the devil is pitching coppers for us
      just now&mdash;and the penny is just hopping off his thumb nail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone was reckless. The excitement of the past few hours was having its
      effect on him at last. He was no longer normal. Something that was almost
      delirium affected him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you frightened?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But I'm going to keep hustling just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bradish and the cook were squatting amidships in the yawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie down under those thwarts, the two of you, and hang on,&rdquo; cried
      Mayo. Then he quickly passed a rope about the girl's waist and made the
      ends of the line fast to the cleats. &ldquo;I don't know what will happen when
      the old tub dives,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Those five thousand tons of coal will
      take her with a rush when she starts. All I can say is, hold tight and
      pray hard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gad, she's got grit!&rdquo; muttered the young man, scrambling forward over
      the prostrate forms of the other passengers. &ldquo;I wonder if all the women in
      the world are this way?&rdquo; He was remembering the bravery of Polly Candage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a huge coil of rope in the bow, spare cable stored there. Mayo
      made fast the free end, working as rapidly as he was able, and bundled
      about half the coil into a compact mass&mdash;a knob at the end of some
      ten fathoms of line. And to this knob he lashed oars and the mast he found
      stowed in the boat. He knew that if they did get free from the schooner
      only an efficient sea-anchor or drag would keep the yawl right side up.
      When this task was finished he crouched low in the bow and looked at the
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're about ready to start on our journey,&rdquo; he called to her. &ldquo;If I don't
      see you again, good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not say good-by to you, Captain Mayo&mdash;not yet!&rdquo;
     </p>

      XXIV ~ DOWN A GALLOPING SEA
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     I saddled me an Arab steed and saddled her another,
     And off we rode together just like sister and like brother,
     Singing, &ldquo;Blow ye winds in the morning!
          Blow ye winds, hi ho! Brush away the morning dew,
          Blow ye winds, hi ho!&rdquo;
                           &mdash;Blew Ye Winds.
</pre>
    <p>
      With anxiety that was almost despairing Mayo looked up at the shrouds,
      stays, and halyards, which were set like nets to right and left and
      overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      A big roller tumbled inboard and filled the space forward of the break of
      the main-deck. The swirling water touched the sides of the long-boat and
      then receded when the stricken schooner struggled up from the welter. A
      scuttle-butt was torn from its lashings and went by the board, and other
      flotsam followed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo found that spectacle encouraging. But the longboat sat high in its
      chocks; when it did float it might be too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another wave roared past, and the long-boat quivered. Then Mayo took a
      chance without reckoning on consequences. He made a double turn of the
      cable around his forearm and leaped out of the boat and stood on deck, his
      shoulder against the stem. The next wave washed him to his waist, tore at
      him, beat him against the long-boat's shoe, but he clung fast and lifted
      and pushed with all his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      That push did it!
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat needed just that impetus to free her from the chocks. She lifted
      and rushed stern foremost to lee, and the young man dragged after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the boat dipped and halted in a hollow of the sea he clutched the bow
      and clambered in. Tugging mightily, he managed to dump the sea-anchor
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next wave caught her on the quarter and slopped a barrel of water into
      her. But she kept right side up, and in a few moments the cable
      straightened and she rode head into the tumult of the ocean; the
      sea-anchor was dragging and performing its service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo was obliged to kick the two men with considerable heartiness before
      he could stir them to bailing with the buckets. The bedraggled cat fled to
      the shelter of the girl's arms. Mayo struggled aft, in order to take his
      weight from the bow of the boat, and when he sat down beside the girl she
      was &ldquo;mothering&rdquo; the animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's coming in faster than I can throw it out!&rdquo; wailed Bradish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bail faster, then! Bail or drown!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's leaking,&rdquo; announced the cook. &ldquo;She has been on deck so long she has
      got all dried out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bail or drown!&rdquo; repeated Mayo. To the girl he said: &ldquo;This seems to be the
      only way of getting work out of cowards. They'll have to do it. I'm about
      done for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The waves were lifting and dropping them in dizzying fashion. There was
      suddenly a more violent tossing of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the old packet! She went under then!&rdquo; Mayo explained. &ldquo;Thank the
      Lord we are out of her clutches! I was afraid we were stuck there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any hope for us now?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. If the boat stays afloat and the wind doesn't haul and
      knock this sea crossways, if somebody sees us in the morning, if we don't
      get rolled onto the coast in the breakers and&mdash;&rdquo; He did not finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems that a lot of things can happen at sea,&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fact has been proved to me in the past few weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean in the past few hours, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Marston, what has happened on that schooner is a part of the
      business, and a sailor must take it as it comes along. I wish nothing
      worse had happened to me than what's happening now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no matter about it,&rdquo; he said, curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men, kneeling amidships, clutching a thwart and bailing with their
      free hands, toiled away; even Bradish had wakened to the fact that he was
      working for his own salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the obscurity the waves which rose ahead seemed like mountains topped
      with snow. Hollows and hills of water swept past on their right and left.
      But the crests of the waves were not breaking, and this fact meant respite
      from immediate danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry it was all left to you to do,&rdquo; ventured the girl, breaking a
      long silence. &ldquo;I thought Ralph had more man in him,&rdquo; she added, bitterly.
      &ldquo;I feel that he ought to apologize to you for&mdash;for several things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He, on his part, did not reply to that. He was afraid that she intended to
      draw him into argument or explanation. Just what he would be able to say
      to her on that topic was not clear to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems as if years had gone by instead of hours. It seems as if I had
      lived half a life since I left home. It seems as if I had changed my
      nature and had grown up to see things in a different light. It is all very
      strange to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not know whether she were talking to herself or to him. He did not
      offer comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long period of silence. The sound of rushing waters filled,
      that silence and made their conversation audible only to themselves when
      they talked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand how you happened to be on that schooner&mdash;as&mdash;as
      you were,&rdquo; she said, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't rig myself out this way to play any practical jokes, Miss
      Marston,&rdquo; he returned, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to know how it all happened&mdash;your side of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have talked too much already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no more conversation for a long time. He wondered how she had
      mustered courage to talk at all. They were in a predicament to try the
      courage of even a seasoned seaman. In the night, tossed by that wild sea,
      drifting they knew not where, she had apparently disregarded danger. He
      asked himself if she had not merely exhibited feminine ignorance of what
      their situation meant. He had often seen cases where apparent bravado was
      based on such ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say that you told me at least one truth a while ago&mdash;you are
      not a coward,&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was comforting the wretched cat. &ldquo;But I am miserably frightened,&rdquo; she
      admitted. &ldquo;I don't dare to think about the thing. I don't dare to look at
      the waves. I talked to you so as to take my mind off my troubles. I didn't
      mean to be prying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you what has been done to me,&rdquo; he blurted. &ldquo;Hearing somebody's
      troubles may take your mind off your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the two men amidships bailed doggedly and weariedly, he told his
      story as briefly as he could. The gray dawn showed her face to him after a
      time, and he was peculiarly comforted by the sympathy he saw there. He did
      not communicate to her any suspicions he may have entertained. With sailor
      directness he related how he had hoped, and how all had been snatched away
      from him. But on one topic the mouths of both seemed to be sealed!
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time Bradish and the cook were enabled to rest from the work of
      bailing. The planks of the boat swelled and the leak was stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better crawl aft here and sit beside Miss Marston,&rdquo; advised Mayo.
      &ldquo;Be careful how you move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed Bradish and took the latter's place with the cook, and felt a
      sense of relief; he had feared that the one, the dreaded topic would force
      itself upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see no sense in prolonging all this agony,&rdquo; averred his
      despondent companion. &ldquo;We ain't ever going to get out of this alive. We're
      drifting in on the coast, and you know what that means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may jump overboard any time you see fit,&rdquo; said the skipper of the
      craft. &ldquo;I don't need you any longer for bailing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that's the way you feel about it, you won't get rid of me so easy,&rdquo;
       declared the cook, malevolence in his single eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo noticed, with some surprise, that after the two had exchanged a few
      words there was silence between Bradish and the girl. The New-Yorker was
      pale and trembling, and his jaw still sagged, and he threw glances to
      right and left as the surges galloped under them. He was plainly and
      wholly occupied with his fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      When day came at last without rain, but with heavy skies, in which masses
      of vapor dragged, Mayo began eager search of the sea. He had no way of
      determining their whereabouts; he hoped they were far enough off-shore to
      be in the track of traffic. However, he could see no sail, no encouraging
      trail of smoke. But after a time he did behold something which was not
      encouraging. He stood up and balanced himself and gazed westward, in the
      direction in which they were drifting; every now and then a lifting wave
      enabled him to command a wide expanse of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw a white ribbon of foam that stretched its way north and south into
      the obscurity of the mists. He did not report this finding at once. He
      looked at his companions and pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you have something to say to me,&rdquo; suggested the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I ought to say it. I've been wondering just how it ought to be
      said. It's not pleasant news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am prepared to hear anything, Captain Mayo. Nothing matters a great
      deal just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are being driven on to the coast. I don't know whether it's the
      Delaware or the New Jersey coast. It doesn't make much difference. The
      breakers are just as bad in one place as in the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you anchor this boat? Are you going to let it go ashore and be
      wrecked?&rdquo; asked Bradish, with anger that was childish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The anchor seems to have been overlooked when we started on this little
      excursion. As I remember it, there was some hurry and bustle,&rdquo; returned
      Mayo, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you remember it? You got us into this scrape. You slammed and
      bossed everybody around. You didn't give anybody else a chance to think.
      You call yourself a sailor! You're a devil of a sailor to come off without
      an anchor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; admitted Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there wasn't any sense, in coming off in this little boat. We ought
      to have stayed on the schooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ralph!&rdquo; protested the girl. &ldquo;Have you completely lost your mind? Don't
      you know that the schooner sank almost the minute we left it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bradish's mind was very much occupied at the time,&rdquo; said Captain
      Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe the schooner sank. What does a girl know about such
      things? That fellow got scared, that's the trouble. There isn't any sense
      in leaving a big boat in a storm. We would have been taken off before
      this. We would have been all right. This is what comes of letting a fool
      boss you around when he is scared,&rdquo; he raved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the fool!&rdquo; she cried, with passion. &ldquo;Captain Mayo saved us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saved us from what? Here we are going into the breakers&mdash;and he says
      so&mdash;and there's no anchor on here. He took everything out of my
      hands. Now why doesn't he do something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't pay any attention to him,&rdquo; she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going to be drowned! You can't deny it, can you? We're going to
      die!&rdquo; He pulled a trembling hand from between his knees, where he had held
      both hands pinched in order to steady them. He shook his fist at Mayo.
      &ldquo;Own up, now. We're going to die, aren't we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it's right to tell the truth at this stage,&rdquo; said Mayo, in steady
      tones. &ldquo;We're not children. Yonder is a beach with sand-reefs and
      breakers, and when we strike the sand this boat will go over and over and
      we shall be tossed out. The waves will throw us up and haul us back like a
      cat playing with mice. And we stand about the same chance as mice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that's the best you can do for us&mdash;and you call yourself a
      sailor!&rdquo; whined Bradish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm only a poor chap who has done his best as it came to his hand to do,&rdquo;
       said the young man, seeking the girl's eyes with his.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him for a moment and then put both hands to her face and
      began to sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a hard thing to face, but we'd better understand the truth and be as
      brave as we can,&rdquo; said Mayo, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For myself I ain't a mite surprised,&rdquo; averred the cook. &ldquo;I had my hunch!
      I was resigned. But my plans was interfered with. I wanted to go down in
      good, deep, green, clean water like a sailor ought to. And now I'm going
      to get mauled into the sand and have a painful death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; barked Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was trembling, and he feared collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradish began to blubber. &ldquo;I'm not prepared to die,&rdquo; he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo studied his passenger for some time, wrinkling his brows. &ldquo;Bradish,
      listen to me a moment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The New-Yorker gave him as much attention as terror and grief permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't much we can do just now to fix up our general earthly
      affairs. But we may as well clean the slate between us two. That will help
      our consciences a little. I haven't any quarrel with you any more. We
      won't be mushy about it. But let's cross it off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all over,&rdquo; mourned Bradish. &ldquo;So what's the use of bearing grudges?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it's true that the court has indicted me for manslaughter.
      Bradish, tell me, man to man, whether I've got to go into those breakers
      with that on my conscience!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you do! You know whether those men of the schooner <i>Warren</i>
      were drowned by any criminal mistake of mine or not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bradish did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't have said as much to Captain Downs if you hadn't known
      something,&rdquo; insisted the victim of the plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only what Burkett let drop when he came after some money. I
      suppose he thought it was safe to talk to me. But what's the good of my
      giving you guesswork? I don't know anything definite. I don't understand
      sailor matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bradish, what Burkett said&mdash;was it something about the compass&mdash;about
      putting a job over on me by monkeying with the compass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was something like that.&rdquo; His tone exhibited indifference; it was
      evident that he was more occupied with his terror than with his
      confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't Burkett say something about a magnet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got off some kind of a joke about Fogg in the pilot-house and fog
      outside&mdash;but that the Fogg inside did the business. And he said
      something about Fogg's iron wishbone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that was the way it was done&mdash;and done by the general manager of
      the line!&rdquo; cried Mayo. &ldquo;The general manager himself! It's no wonder I have
      smashed that suspicion between the eyes every time it bobbed up! I
      suspected&mdash;but I didn't dare to suspect! Is that some of your high
      finance, Bradish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn't,&rdquo; declared the New-Yorker, with heat. &ldquo;It's an understrapper
      like Fogg going ahead and producing results, so he calls it. The big men
      never bother with the details.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The details! Taking away from me all I have worked for&mdash;my
      reputation as a master, my papers, my standing&mdash;my liberty. By the
      gods, I'm going to live! I'm going through those breakers! I'll face that
      gang like a man who has fought his way back from hell,&rdquo; raged the victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This&mdash;this was none of my father's business! It could not have
      been,&rdquo; expostulated Miss Marston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father never knows anything about the details of Fogg's operations,&rdquo;
       declared Bradish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to know,&rdquo; insisted the maddened scapegoat. &ldquo;He gives off his
      orders, doesn't he? He sits in the middle of the web. What if he did know
      how Fogg was operating?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably wouldn't stand for it! But he doesn't know. And the Angel
      Gabriel himself wouldn't get a chance to tell him!&rdquo; declared the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A put-up job, then, is it&mdash;and all called high finance!&rdquo; jeered
      Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High finance isn't to blame for tricks the field-workers put out so that
      they can earn their money quick and easy. What's the good of pestering me
      with questions at this awful time? I'm going to die! I'm going to die!&rdquo; he
      wailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Marston slid from the seat to her knees, in order that she might be
      able to reach her hand to Mayo. &ldquo;Will you let this handclasp tell you all
      I feel about it&mdash;all your trouble, all your brave work in this
      terrible time? I am so frightened, Captain Mayo! But I'm going to keep my
      eyes on you&mdash;and I'll be ashamed to show you how frightened I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned the fervent clasp of her fingers with gentle pressure and
      reassuring smile. &ldquo;Honestly, I feel too ugly to die just now. Let's keep
      on hoping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when he stood up and beheld the white mountains of water between their
      little boat and the shore, and realized what would happen when they were
      in that savage tumult, with the undertow dragging and the surges lashing,
      he felt no hope within himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the appearance of the coast he could not determine their probable
      location. The land was barren and sandy. There seemed to be no inlet. As
      far as he could see the line of frothing white was unbroken. The sea
      foamed across broad shallows, where no boat could possibly remain upright
      and no human being could hope to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he remained standing and peered under his hand, resolved to
      be alert till the last, determined to grasp any opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once he beheld certain black lines in perpendicular silhouette
      against the foam. At first he was not certain just what they could be, and
      he observed them narrowly as the boat tossed on its way.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last their identity was revealed. They were weir-stakes. The weir
      itself was evidently dismantled. Such stakes as remained were set some
      distance from one another, like fence-posts located irregularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made hasty observation of bearings as the boat drifted, and was certain
      that the sea would carry them down past the stakes. How near they would
      pass depended on the vagary of the waves and the tide. He realized that
      three men, even if they were able seamen, could do little in the way of
      rowing or guiding the longboat in the welter of that sea, now surging
      madly over the shoals. He knew that there was not much water under the
      keel, for the ocean was turbid with swirling sand, and the waves were more
      mountainous, heaped high by the friction of the water on the bottom. Every
      now and then the crest of a roller flaunted a banner of bursting spray,
      showing breakers near at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo hurried to the bow of the boat and pulled free a long stretch of
      cable. He made a bowline slip-knot, opened a noose as large as he could
      handle, coiled the rest of the cable carefully, and poised himself on a
      thwart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What now?&rdquo; asked the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; returned Mayo. His project was such a gamble that he did not
      care to canvass it in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nearer they drove to the stakes the more unattainable those objects
      seemed. They projected high above the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook perceived them and got up on his knees and squinted. &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he
      sniffed. &ldquo;You'll never make it. It can't be done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his fierce anxiety Mayo heaved his noose too soon, and it fell short.
      He dragged in the cable with all his quickness and strength and threw the
      noose again. The rope hit the stake three-quarters of the way up and fell
      into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It needs a cowboy for that work,&rdquo; muttered the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo recovered his noose and poised himself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the shallows where they were the boat which bore him became a veritable
      bucking bronco. It was flung high, it swooped down into the hollows. He
      made a desperate try for the next stake in line. The noose caught, and he
      snubbed quickly. The top of the stake came away with a dull crack of
      rotten wood when the next wave lifted the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo pulled in his rope hand over hand with frantic haste. He was obliged
      to free the broken stake from the noose and pull his extemporized lasso
      into position again. He made a wider noose. His failure had taught a point
      or two. He waited till the boat was on the top of a wave. He curbed his
      desperate impatience, set his teeth, and whirled the noose about his head
      in a widening circle. Then he cast just as the boat began to drop. The
      rope encircled the stake, dropped to the water, and he paid out all his
      free cable so that a good length of the heavy rope might lie in the water
      and form a makeshift bridle. When he snubbed carefully the noose drew
      close around the stake, and the latter held. The waves which rode under
      them were terrific, and Mayo's heart came into his mouth every time a tug
      and shock indicated that the rope had come taut.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, after five minutes of anxious waiting, kneeling in the bow, his
      eyes on the cable, he found his courage rising and his hopes glowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it mean&mdash;&rdquo; gasped the girl, when he turned and looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know just what it will mean in the end, Miss Marston,&rdquo; he said,
      with emotion. &ldquo;But it's a reprieve while that rope holds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bradish sat clutching the gunwale with both hands, staring over his
      shoulder at the waters frothing and roaring on the shore. The girl glanced
      at him occasionally with a certain wonderment in her expression. It seemed
      to Mayo that she was trying to assure herself that Bradish was some person
      whom she knew. But she did not appear to have much success in making him
      seem real. She spoke to him once or twice in an undertone, but he did not
      answer. Then she turned her back on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Mayo leaped up and shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man was running along the sandy crest of a low hill near the beach. He
      disappeared in a little structure that was no larger than a sentry-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a coast-guard patrol from the life-saving station. There must be
      one somewhere along here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man rushed out and flourished his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has telephoned,&rdquo; explained Mayo. &ldquo;Those are the boys! There's hope for
      us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was more than hope&mdash;there was rescue after some hours of dreary
      and anxious waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The life-boat came frothing down the sea from the distant inlet, and they
      were lifted on board by strong arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Alma Marston gave Mayo the strangest look he had ever received
      from a woman's eyes. But her lips grew white and her eyes closed, and she
      lapsed into unconsciousness while he folded a blanket about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have had quite a job of it, managing a woman through this
      scrape,&rdquo; suggested the captain of the crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's just the other way,&rdquo; declared Mayo. &ldquo;I'm giving her credit for
      saving the whole of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might find it a little hard to make you understand, captain. Let it
      stand as I have said it.&rdquo;
     </p>

      XXV ~ A GIRL AND HER DEBT OF HONOR
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Says she, &ldquo;You lime-juice sailor,
        Now see me home you may.&rdquo;
      But when we reached her cottage door
        She unto me did say&mdash;
           And a-way, you santee,
           My dear Annie!
           O you New York girls,
           Can't you dance the polka!
             &mdash;Walking Down the Broadway.
</pre>
    <p>
      Mayo was promptly informed that Captain Downs and the crew of the <i>Alden</i>
      were safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He caught our flare, got his motor to working, and made the inlet by a
      lucky stab,&rdquo; explained the coast-station captain. &ldquo;But he didn't reckon
      he'd ever see you folks again. How did it happen he didn't tell me there
      was a woman aboard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to ask him that, too. I'm only a sailor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain looked him over with considerable suspicion: His shirt was
      torn and his white skin was revealed. The drenching by rain and spray had
      played havoc with his disguise; most of the coloring had been washed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got anything special to say about yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain turned his back on his men and leaned close to Mayo. &ldquo;They
      have had your picture in the paper this week,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You're the
      captain they are wanting in that <i>Montana</i> case. They're after you.
      I've got to report on this thing, you understand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I reckon we'll talk it all over after we get to the station,&rdquo; said
      the master, kindly. &ldquo;There may be something in it that I don't
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's considerable in it that I don't understand myself, just now, but
      I'm going to find out,&rdquo; declared Captain Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      They placed Ahpa Marston in the care of the station captain's wife as soon
      as they were safely on shore in the inlet. Fortunate chance had sent the
      woman to the station that day on a visit to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Downs, fed and warmed, watched the new arrivals eat beside the
      kitchen stove and listened to the story Mayo had for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bedraggled cat lapped milk, protected from the resentful jealousy of
      the station's regular feline attaché by the one-eyed cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      And afterward, closeted with Captain Downs and the station captain, Mayo
      went over his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say you seem to be pretty hard and fast ashore in mighty sloppy
      water,&rdquo; commented the coastguard captain. &ldquo;It isn't my especial business&mdash;but
      what do you propose to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to New York and take what they're going to hand me, I suppose. I ought
      to have stayed there and faced the music. I have put myself in bad by
      running away. But I was rattled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best of us get rattled,&rdquo; said the host, consolingly. &ldquo;I'm not a
      policeman, sheriff, or detective, mate. I'll report this case as Captain
      Downs and so many souls saved from the schooner <i>Alden</i>. You'd better
      trot along up to the city and face 'em as a man should. I'll rig you out
      in some of my clothes. Your old friend, Wass, meant well by rushing you
      away, but I've always found that in a man's fight you can't do much unless
      you're close enough to t'other fellow to hit him when he reaches for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A half-hour later, made presentable in the coast-guard captain's liberty
      suit, Mayo walked through the kitchen. Bradish and the cook were still in
      front of the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain's wife, standing in a door which admitted to an inner room,
      put up a finger to signal the young man and then nodded her head in
      invitation. &ldquo;The young lady wants to see you, sir,&rdquo; she informed him in a
      whisper, when he stepped to her side. &ldquo;Go in!&rdquo; She closed the door behind
      him and remained in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood in the middle of the room and gazed at the girl for some time,
      and neither of them spoke. She was swathed in blankets and was huddled in
      a big chair; her face was wan and her eyes showed her weariness. But her
      voice was firm and earnest when she addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Mayo, what I am going to say to you will sound very strange. Tell
      me that you'll listen to me as you would listen to a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid&mdash;&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too bad that man and woman can seldom meet on the plane where man
      and man meet. But I don't want to be considered a girl just now. I'm one
      human being, and you're another, and I owe something to you which must be
      paid, or I shall be disgraced by a debt which will worry me all my life.&rdquo;
       She put out her hands and knotted the fingers together in appeal.
      &ldquo;Understand me&mdash;help me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was ill at ease. He feared with all his soul to meet the one great
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we thought we were going to die I told you it seemed as if I had
      lived a life in a few hours&mdash;that I did not seem like the same person
      as I looked into my thoughts. Captain Mayo, that is true. It is more
      apparent to me now when I have had time to search my soul. Oh, I am not
      the Alma Marston who has been spoiled and indulged&mdash;a fool leaping
      here and there with every impulse&mdash;watching a girl in my set do a
      silly thing and then doing a sillier thing in order to astonish her. That
      has been our life in the city. I never knew what it meant to be a mere
      human being, near death. You know you saved me from that death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only did what a man ought to do, Miss Marston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. But you did it, that's the point. There are other men&mdash;&rdquo;
       She hesitated. &ldquo;I have had a talk with Mr. Bradish,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;It was
      a mistake. You saved me from that mistake. You did it in the cabin of the
      schooner. He has told me. It was better for me than saving my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But because a man isn't a sailor&mdash;isn't used to danger&mdash;&rdquo; he
      expostulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not it. I say I have just had a talk with Mr. Bradish! I have
      found out exactly what he is. I did not find it out when I danced with
      him. But now that I have come near to dying with him I have found him
      out.&rdquo; The red banners in her cheeks signaled both shame and indignation.
      &ldquo;A coward will show all his nature before he gets himself in hand again,
      and Mr. Bradish has shown me that he is willing to ruin and disgrace me in
      order to make profit for himself. And there is no more to be said about
      him!&rdquo; She paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Mayo, I know what idea you must have of me&mdash;of a girl who
      would do what I have done! But you don't have half the scorn for me I have
      for myself&mdash;for the girl I was. But I have my self-respect now! I
      respect the woman that I am at this moment after that experience! Perhaps
      you don't understand. I do! I'm glad I have that self-respect. I shall
      face what is ahead of me. I shall do right from now on.&rdquo; She spoke quickly
      and passionately, and he wanted to say something, but his sailor tongue
      halted. &ldquo;I am not going to bring up a certain matter&mdash;not now! It's
      too sacred. I am too miserably ashamed! Again, Captain Mayo, I say that I
      want to stand with you as man to man! I want to render service for what
      you have done for me. You have lost everything out of your life that you
      value. I want you to have it back. Will you listen to me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Marston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go to my father with a letter from me. I do not believe he knows what
      kind of methods have been practised by his understrappers, but he can find
      out. You tell him that he must find out&mdash;that he must make them
      confess. You tell him that this is a man's fight, and that you are
      fighting back with all the strength that you can command. You tell him
      that you have me hidden, and that I cannot get away&mdash;as my own letter
      will tell him. You tell him that he must make a fair exchange with you&mdash;give
      you back what is yours before he can have what is his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo walked backward limply, feeling for the wall with his hands behind
      him, and leaned against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are single-handed&mdash;it's a big game they play up in the city when
      they are after money&mdash;and you must take what cards are offered,&rdquo; she
      insisted, displaying the shrewdness of the Marston nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say that I'm going to your father as if I were holding you
      for ransom?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; she returned, eagerly. &ldquo;The only way you'll get
      what you want&mdash;and get it quickly&mdash;is by a good bluff. I have
      had some good samples of your courage, Captain Mayo. You can do it
      beautifully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm not going to do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by a&mdash;&rdquo; His feelings were carrying him away. He was forgetting
      that these dealings were with an impulsive girl. His anger was mounting.
      She was putting him on the plane of a blackleg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead and talk as strongly as you like, Captain Mayo. It will make it
      seem like man's business between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those tricks may be all right in Wall Street, but they don't do for me.
      And you've got a pretty poor opinion of me if you think I'll do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be quixotic,&rdquo; she protested, impatiently. &ldquo;We are living in
      up-to-date times, Captain Mayo. Some of those underlings have played a
      nasty trick on you. They must be exposed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a girl's crazy notion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Mayo, is this the way you help me pay my debt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't owe me anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you pay me an insult! Are my honor as a girl and my life worth
      nothing? You have saved both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how to talk to you. I haven't had any experience in talking
      with women. I simply say that I'm not going to your father in any such
      manner. Certainly not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you realize what I have offered you?&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;You are
      throwing my sacrifice in my face. As the case stands now, I can hurry off
      to the home of some girl friend and make up a little story of a foolish
      lark, and my father will never know what has been happening. He expects me
      to do a lot of silly things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's your business&mdash;and his,&rdquo; he returned, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Mayo, I have been trying to show you that I am fit to be
      considered something besides a silly girl. I wanted you to know that I
      have a sense of obligation. The plan may seem like a girl's romantic
      notion. But it isn't. It's bold, and your case heeds boldness. I was
      trying to show you that I'm not a coward. I was going to confess to my
      father what I have done and start on the level with him. You throw it all
      in my face&mdash;you insult my plan by calling it crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he insisted, doggedly. &ldquo;And I'm in bad enough as it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you're afraid, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He frowned. Her sneer seemed gratuitous injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not understand that variety of feminine guile which seeks to goad
      to action one who refuses to be led.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admire boldness in a man when his case is desperate and he is trying to
      save himself. I have lived among men who are bold in going after what they
      want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had a little experience with that kind of land pirates, and I
      don't like the system.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not make any unnecessary sacrifices,&rdquo; she de-clared, tartly, but
      there were tears in her eyes. &ldquo;I did what I could to help you when you
      were trying to save me. Why are you so ungenerous as to refuse to help me
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's taking advantage of you&mdash;of your position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I offer it&mdash;I beg of you to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You absolutely refuse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Marston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall leave you to your own fate, Captain Mayo. You don't expect
      me to go to my father with the story, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go ahead now and protect myself the best I can. I am sure that
      Captain Downs will keep my secret. I shall forget that I ever sailed on
      that schooner. I suppose you will black yourself up and run away again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be put in jail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me very angry. After you have shown that you can fight, just
      when you ought to fight the hardest you slink bade to be whipped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Marston, if you care to put it that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps each expected that the other would break the wall of reserve at
      this moment of parting. He hesitated a moment&mdash;an awkward instant&mdash;then
      he bowed and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Downs walked with Mayo for a distance across the sand-dunes when
      the latter started to make his way to the nearest railroad station. The
      captain intended to remain at the inlet tmtil a representative of the <i>Alden's</i>
      owners arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left Bradish still huddled behind the stove in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless my eyes have gone back on me, Captain Mayo, my notion is that the
      dude is wasting his time hanging around that girl any more,&rdquo; suggested
      Captain Downs. &ldquo;She has had him out on the marine railway of love, has
      made proper survey, and has decided that she would hate to sail the sea of
      matrimony with him. Don't you think that's so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you're a good judge of what you see, Captain Downs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon that you and I as gents and master mariners are going to keep
      mum about her being aboard the <i>Alden?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The coast-guard crew don't know who she is, and they can't find out. So
      she can go home and mind her business from this time out. 'Most every
      woman does one infernal fool thing in her life&mdash;and then is all right
      ever after. But now a word on some subject that's sensible! What are you
      going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stick my head into the noose. It's about the only thing I can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you'll talk up to 'em, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll play what few cards I hold as best I know, sir. The most I can hope
      for is to make 'em drop that manslaughter case. Perhaps I can say enough
      so that they'll be afraid to bring me to trial. As to getting my papers
      back, I'm afraid that's out of the question. I'll have to start life over
      in something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mayo, why don't you go to the captain's office?&rdquo; He promptly answered the
      young man's glance of inquiry. &ldquo;Julius Marston himself is the supreme boss
      of that steamship-consolidation business. Bradish gave all that part away,
      telling about those checks; though, of course, we all knew about Marston
      before. It is probably likely that Marston gives true courses to his
      understrappers. If they take fisherman's cuts between buoys in order to
      get there quick, I'll bet he doesn't know about it. Go to him and tell
      him, man to man, what has happened to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two reasons why I shall probably never see Mr. Marston,&rdquo;
       returned Mayo, grimly. &ldquo;First, I'll be arrested before I can get across
      New York to his office; second, I'll never get farther than the outer
      office. He's guarded like the Czar of Russia, so they tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does his girl know anything about your case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I blabbed it to her&mdash;like a fool&mdash;when we were in the boat. Why
      is it that when a man is drunk or excited or in trouble, he'll blow the
      whole story of his life to a woman?&rdquo; growled Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've thought that over some, myself,&rdquo; admitted Captain Downs. &ldquo;Especially
      on occasions when I've come to and realized what I've let out. I suppose
      it's this&mdash;more or less: A man don't tell his troubles to another
      man, for he knows that the other man is usually in'ardly glad of it
      because any friend is in trouble. But a woman's sympathy is like a
      flaxseed poultice&mdash;it soothes the ache and draws at the same time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo trudged on in silence, kicking the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me the smallest thing that girl could have done was to offer to
      get you a hearing with her old man. It was some chore you did for her,
      mate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to save myself. A few more in the party didn't matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These society girls think of themselves first, of course! I don't suppose
      you give a hoot for my advice, Captain Mayo, but I'm talking to you in the
      best spirit in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you are, Captain Downs,&rdquo; declared the young man, his sullenness
      departing. &ldquo;I didn't mean to show bristles to you! I'll try to see
      Marston. It 'll be a hard stunt. But I'm in the mood to try anything. By
      gad! if they lug me to jail, I'll go kicking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the spirit, boy. And if you can get in a few kicks where Julius
      Marston can see 'em they may count. He's the boss! I don't think I'll go
      any farther with you. This is too hard footing for an old waddler like me.
      Good luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands and turned their backs on each other with sailor
      repression in the matter of the emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man went on his way, wondering in numbed despair how he could
      have left Alma Marston with merely a curt word of farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo lurked that evening in the purlieus of Jersey City, and entered the
      metropolis after midnight on a ferryboat which had few passengers and
      afforded him a dark corner where he was alone. He found lodgings in humble
      quarters on the East Side.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning he nerved himself to the ordeal of appearing in the
      streets. His belief in his own innocence made his suffering greater as he
      waited for the clap of a heavy hand on his shoulder and the summons of an
      officer's voice. He knew that the eyes of Uncle Sam are sharp and his
      reach a long one. He had firm belief in the almost uncanny vigilance of
      government officers. He was rather surprised to find himself at last in
      the outer office of Marston &amp; Waller.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on a bench and waited for a time in order to regain his
      self-possession. He wanted to control features and voice before accosting
      one of the guardians of the magnate. But the espionage of the attendants
      did not permit loiterers to remain long in that place without explanation.
      A man tiptoed to him and asked his name and his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name doesn't matter,&rdquo; said Mayo. &ldquo;But I have important business with
      Mr. Marston. If you will tell him that the business is most important&mdash;that
      it is something he ought to know, and that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't any appointment, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think for one moment that you can get in to see Mr. Marston
      without giving your name and explaining beforehand the nature of your
      business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoped so, for it is important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's private&mdash;it's something for Mr. Marston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; was the man's curt rejoinder. He went back to his post. In a
      few moments he returned to Mayo. &ldquo;You mustn't remain here. You cannot see
      Mr. Marston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you take in a message from me? I'll explain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain to me. That's what I'm here for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Telling that cold-blooded person that this visitor was the broken master
      of the <i>Montana</i> was out of the question. To mention the case of the
      <i>Montana</i> to this watchdog was dangerous. But Mayo dreaded to go back
      to the street again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll stay here a little while and perhaps I can&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you stay here without explaining your business I'll have you escorted
      down to the street by an officer, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo rose and hurried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An officer!&rdquo; Even in his despairing and innocent quest of a hearing he
      was threatened with arrest! He sneaked back to his lodgings and hid
      himself in the squalid apartment and nursed the misery of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Mayo sat till late, toiling over a letter addressed to Julius
      Marston.
    </p>
    <p>
      He despatched it by messenger at an early hour, and mustered his courage
      in the middle of the forenoon and followed in person. He assumed a
      boldness he did not feel in his quaking heart when he approached the
      guardian of the outer office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you ask Mr. Marston if he will see the man who sent him a letter by
      messenger this morning?&rdquo; &ldquo;What letter? Signed by what name?&rdquo; &ldquo;He will
      understand what letter I refer to.&rdquo; &ldquo;He will, will he?&rdquo; The attendant gave
      this applicant sharp scrutiny. The coast-guard captain's liberty garments
      were not impressive, nor did they fit very well. Mayo displayed the
      embarrassment of the man who knew he was hunted. &ldquo;Do you think Mr. Marston
      receives only one letter by messenger in a morning? Look here, my man, you
      were in here yesterday, and I look on you as a suspicious character. You
      cannot see Mr. Marston on any such excuse. Get out of that door inside of
      one minute or I'll send in a police call!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And once more Mayo fled from the danger which threatened him. He bought a
      stock of newspapers at a sidewalk news-stand; his hours of loneliness in
      his little room the day before had tortured him mentally. He sat himself
      down and read them. The news that the Vose line had gone into the
      steamship combination was interesting and significant. Evidently the <i>Montana's</i>
      lay-up had discouraged the mass of stockholders. He had time to kill and
      thoughts to stifle; he went on reading scrupulously, lingering over
      matters in which he had no interest, striving to occupy his mind and drive
      the bitter memories and his fears away from him. Never in his life before
      had he read the society tattle in the newspapers. However, dragging along
      the columns, he found a paragraph on which he dwelt for a long time. It
      stated that Miss Marston of Fifth Avenue had returned by motor from a
      house-party in the Catskills, accompanied by Miss Lana Vanadistine, who
      would be a house guest of Miss Marston's for a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      That bit of news was significant. She had established her alibi; she had
      reinstated herself and had turned a smooth front to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo was certain in his soul that he knew her kind. His illusions were
      departing. Now that her tragic experience was behind her, now that she was
      back among her own, now that the fervor of romance was cool, she was
      thanking God, so he told himself, that she had not sacrificed herself for
      anybody. He was honestly glad that she was at home, glad of the hint which
      the paragraph gave&mdash;that her secret was still her own, so far as
      family and the social world were concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Mayo took further counsel with himself. In the morning his
      final decision was made. He would endeavor once more to see Julius
      Maxston. He determined that he would march into the outer office, boldly
      announce his name, assert that he was there to expose a crime, and tell
      them that if Mr. Marston refused to hear him he should tell what he knew
      to the public through the newspapers; then he would ask them to send for
      the police, if the door of Marston's office remained closed to him. He
      would call attention to himself and to his case by all the uproar he could
      make. When he went to jail he would go with plenty of folks looking on.
      Let Marston and his fellow-financiers see how they liked that!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a desperate and a crude plan, but Mayo was not a diplomat&mdash;he
      was a sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He marched forth on his errand with his chin up and resolve flaming within
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other men, prosperous-looking and rotund men, rode up in the elevator with
      him and went into Marston &amp; Waller's office ahead of him, for he had
      modestly stepped to one side to allow them to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard some talk of a &ldquo;board meeting.&rdquo; It was plain that Mr. Marston was
      to be occupied for a time. This was not a favorable moment in which to
      project himself upon the attention of the financier; he needed a clear
      field. Therefore he tramped up and down the corridor of the office
      building, watching the elevator door, waiting to see the rotund gentlemen
      go on their way. And with attention thus focused he saw Miss Alma Marston
      arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited until the elevator had passed on, and then she came directly to
      him. Her expression did not reveal her mood except to hint that she was
      self-possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not especially surprised to find you here,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;I believe
      you said to Captain Downs&mdash;so he informed me&mdash;that you were
      going to try to see my father. And men who try to see my father, without
      proper introduction, usually kick their heels outside his office for some
      days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a bit of hauteur in her voice. She preserved much of the
      acerbity which had marked her demeanor when they had said good-by to each
      other. He would not acknowledge to himself that he hoped she would meet
      him on another plane; he meekly accepted her attitude as the proper one.
      He was a sailor, and she was the daughter of Julius Marston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you blame me for being suspicious in regard to what you intend to say
      to my father?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;I tell you frankly that I came here looking
      for you. We must settle our affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am trying to get word with him about my own business&mdash;simply my
      own business, Miss Marston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as to me! What are you going to say to him about me? You remember I
      told you that I intended to protect myself,&rdquo; she declared, with some
      insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you had a better opinion of me,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;Miss Marston,
      as far as I am concerned, you never were on that schooner. I know nothing
      about you. I do not even know you. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started away hastily. &ldquo;Don't stay here. Don't speak to me. Somebody may
      see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Come back here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I demand an explicit promise from you that if you are able to talk with
      my father you will never mention my name to him or try to take advantage
      of the dreadful mistake I made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise, on my honor,&rdquo; he said, straightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now that I have promised,&rdquo; he added, red in his tanned cheeks, &ldquo;I
      want to say to you, Miss Marston, that you have insulted me gratuitously.
      I suppose I'm not much in the way of a gentleman as you meet them in
      society. I'm only a sailor. But I'm neither a tattler nor a blackmailer. I
      know the square thing to do where a woman is concerned, and I would have
      done it without being put under a pledge.&rdquo; He bowed and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed after him, a queer sparkle in her eyes. &ldquo;We'll see about you,
      you big child!&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      She entered the waiting-room of the Marston &amp; Waller suite, and was
      informed that her father was busy with a board meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's merely a bit of routine business. It will soon be over, Miss
      Marston&mdash;if you will be so good as to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a time the gentlemen filed out, but she waited on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell my father that I'm here and will be in presently,&rdquo; she commanded the
      guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the messenger returned Mayo came in, rather apprehensively. He
      tried to avoid her, but she met him face to face and accosted him with
      spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that I have put you on your honor, I'm not afraid to have you talk
      your business over with my father. Come with me. I will take you to him.
      Then we will call accounts square between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he consented. &ldquo;After what I have been through here, I feel
      that one service matches the other.&rdquo; Mayo followed her and came into The
      Presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julius Marston was alone, intrenched behind his desk, on his throne of
      business; the dark back of the chair, towering over his head, set off in
      contrast his gray garb and his cold face; to Mayo, who halted respectfully
      just inside the door, he appeared a sort of bas-relief against that
      background&mdash;something insensate, without ears to listen or heart to
      bestow compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, hurrying to him, engaged his attention until she had seated
      herself on the arm of his chair. Then he saw Mayo, recognized him, and
      tried to rise, but she pushed him back, urging him with eager appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must listen to me, father! It is serious! It is important!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He groped for the row of desk buttons, but she held his hand from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo strode forward, determined to speak for himself, rendered
      bold by the courageous sacrifice the girl was making.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word! Not a word! The supreme impudence of it!&rdquo; Marston repeated
      the last phrase several times with increasing violence. He pushed his
      daughter off the arm of the chair and struggled up. Only heroic measures
      could save that situation&mdash;and the girl knew her father! She forced
      herself between him and his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better listen!&rdquo; she warned him, hysterically. &ldquo;A few days ago I ran
      away to be married!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood there, stricken motionless, and she put her hands against his
      breast and pressed him back into his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is not the man, father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marston had been gathering his voice for wild invective, but that last
      statement took away all his power of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I warned you that you'd better listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In that moment she dominated the situation as completely as if she stood
      between the two men with a lighted bomb in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo was overwhelmed even more completely than the financier. He realized
      that her extortion of a pledge from him had been subterfuge; her
      triumphant eyes flashed complete information on that point. Both anger and
      bewilderment made him incapable of any sane attempt to press his case with
      Marston at that time. He turned and started for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop that man, father. You'll be sorry if you do not! He must stay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back here!&rdquo; shouted Marston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo looked behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnate stood with finger on the push-button. &ldquo;Come back, I say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I protest. This is none of my business. I am here for something else than
      to listen to your daughter's private affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come back!&rdquo; commanded the father in low tones of menace, &ldquo;or I'll
      have you held for the United States marshals the minute you step foot
      outside that door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raging within himself at the tactics of this incomprehensible girl,
      Captain Mayo walked slowly to the desk; it occurred to him that it was as
      hard to get out of Julius Marston's office as it was to get in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would never have come in here if I had dreamed that your daughter would
      tell you what she has. I am in a false position. I insist that you allow
      me to leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll leave when I get to the bottom of this thing! Now, Alma, what new
      craziness is all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not resenting the word you apply to it,&rdquo; she replied, facing him
      resolutely. &ldquo;I did it&mdash;and I don't know why I did it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ran away. I did it because the girls dared me to do it. I promised a
      man I would marry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I have told you this is not the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who, then?&rdquo; Incredulity was mingled with her father's wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of your trusted young gentlemen. Mr. Ralph Bradish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you meet him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the dances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at our house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know how you are so sure of that, father,&rdquo; she returned, a touch
      of rather wistful reproach in her tones. &ldquo;You have left me alone in that
      house ever since mother went away. But it was not at our house&mdash;it
      was in the public ball-rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hell set to music!&rdquo; he rasped. &ldquo;I ought to have realized that you are
      still an infant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I am a woman to-day. I lived a whole lifetime in one night on the
      ocean. I know you have reason to be ashamed of me. But I'll never give you
      cause for shame again. Now what are you going to say to this man who saved
      my life&mdash;who did more than that? He saved me from myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marston narrowed his eyes and scrutinized Mayo. &ldquo;I don't understand this
      thing yet! The story doesn't ring right.&rdquo; He turned on his daughter. &ldquo;How
      did this man save your life? Be quick and be short!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He interrupted her in the middle of her eager recital. He had been
      scowling while she talked, staring into vacancy in meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A story-book tale!&rdquo; he declared, impatiently, and yet there was a shade
      of insincerity in that impatience. &ldquo;I would be bitterly ashamed of you,
      Alma, if you had run away as you are trying to make me believe. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you believe me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! But this trumped-up story is too transparent. You are still
      acting the fool in the matter of this person, here. Now see here, my man,
      you are here to-day on the <i>Montana</i> affair. Isn't that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sure of it. How did you dare to sneak into that job after I had
      discharged you from the <i>Olenia</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no sneaking to it! I was hired by Mr. Fogg and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure that I did not know you were on board the <i>Montana</i>.
      But I cannot attend to all the details of my business. You realize, don't
      you, that you are a fugitive from justice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a scapegoat for the dirty dogs who operate for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's enough! I am investigating this matter now? Sit down in that
      chair!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo obeyed, lulled by the assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alma, you go home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to stay here, father, until Captain Mayo&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have listened to all the falsehoods I propose to hear!&rdquo; This rejoinder
      astounded his two listeners. &ldquo;I see into this matter clear to the bottom.
      I am amazed that you should think such a silly yarn would deceive me for a
      moment.&rdquo; He had pressed one of the buttons. To the man who opened the door
      he said: &ldquo;Tell Mr. Bradish that I want to see him here at once. He is in
      the office, isn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir! I will inform him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo and the girl exchanged eloquent looks; they had been leaving Mr.
      Bradish out of their calculations; they had discarded him from their
      thoughts; that he had had the effrontery to reappear in the Marston &amp;
      Waller offices was news indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marston took the girl by the arm and led her toward a door. &ldquo;I tell you to
      go home!&rdquo; he cried, angrily, stopping her protests. &ldquo;No, you are going by
      this side door. I do not believe one word you have told me. It's all a
      transparent attempt to continue your folly. I'll know how to look after
      you from now on!&rdquo; He closed the door behind her and locked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear this is all true, sir,&rdquo; pleaded Mayo. &ldquo;I'm not trying to deceive
      you through your daughter. I did not understand what she intended to say.
      I want my rights as a man who has been tricked, abused&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bradish appeared, bowing respectfully. He was once more part of the
      smooth machinery of the Marston &amp; Waller offices. He was pale, calm,
      cool, subdued master of his emotions as the employees of Julius Marston
      were trained to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see this man before? Of course you never did!&rdquo; prompted the
      financier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw him before, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not! What have you to say to the ridiculous, nonsensical story
      that you attempted to elope with my daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not by a flicker of the eyelids did the imperturbable maker of
      million-dollar checks show confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If such a lie needs denial from me I most firmly do deny it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cheap renegade!&rdquo; roared the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, Mr. Bradish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk obeyed the wave of his master's hand and retired quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Marston,&rdquo; raved Mayo, &ldquo;I'm fighting for all that's worth while to me
      in life. My reputation as a master mariner, my chance to make a living in
      my work. I was a fool on board your yacht! With all my soul I am penitent.
      I will-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough! Don't you dare to discuss my own daughter with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't intend to, sir. I'm going to believe that you don't know what
      your understrappers have done to me. You only see results. But find out
      what is being done in your name, Mr. Marston. Some day it will be bad for
      you if you don't stop 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that a threat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only my appeal for justice. My God, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's justice waiting for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then send out for your marshals. Let them drag me into court! Your man
      Bradigh's mouth is closed now, but it has been open. I know what has been
      done to me. Let them put me on the stand. You don't dare to have me stand
      up in court and tell what I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose I am running the Federal courts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better find out whether you have power or not. There are men in
      this world who will believe an honest man's true story!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day!&rdquo; said Mr. Marston, significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo hesitated, gazed into the impassive countenance of the magnate, and
      then conviction of the uselessness of argument overwhelmed him. He started
      for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certain sensible things can be done,&rdquo; Marston called after him. &ldquo;You'd
      better get out of New York. If you know of a place to hide you'd better
      get into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo did not reply. He strode out through the offices, descended to the
      street, and went on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not notice that an automobile pursued him through the roaring
      traffic of the streets, halting ahead of him when, he had turned into one
      of the quieter thoroughfares.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car was close to the curb, and Alma Marston put out her hand and
      signaled to him. &ldquo;He gave-you no hope-nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have waited. I thought of asking you to come for a talk with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it's better as it is! There isn't very much to be said-not now!&rdquo;
       She leaned over the side of the tonneau and the clatter of traffic enabled
      her to talk without taking the eavesdropping chauffeur into their
      confidence. &ldquo;I am not worthy of your thoughts or your confidence after
      this, Boyd. What I was yesterday I am not to-day; I have told you that.
      No, do not say anything! I know, now, that I was only playing with love. I
      cannot name what I feel for you now; I have insulted the word 'love' too
      much in the past. I'm not going to say anything about it. Was it any
      excuse for me that you had sunk a ship, were going to prison for killing
      men, so the papers hinted? No, it was not! But I allowed myself to make it
      an excuse for folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know what love is,&rdquo; he declared. In the agony of his
      degradation he had no relish for softer sentiments. But he did not dare to
      look up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>did</i> not know! But perhaps some day I can show you that I do now
      know,&rdquo; she replied, humbly. &ldquo;That will be the day when I can give you the
      proofs against the men who have tried to ruin you. I am inside the camp of
      your enemies, Boyd, and I'll give you those proofs&mdash;even against my
      own father, if he is guilty. That's all! Let's wait. But while you are
      working I hope it's going to give you a bit of courage to know that I am
      working for you!&rdquo; She patted his cheek. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; she called to her driver.
      The car jerked forward and was hidden among the chariots roaring down
      through the modern Babylon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without power for self-analysis, without being able to penetrate the inner
      recesses of his own soul in that crisis, he trudged on.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later, almost unconscious of volition in the matter, he found
      himself at a steamboat office buying a ticket. He was going back to the
      obscurity of Maquoit. But he was fully conscious that he was not obeying
      Julius Marston's injunction to go and hide. A deeper sentiment was drawing
      him. He knew where there existed simple faith in him and affection for
      him, and he craved that solace. There were humble folks in Maquoit who
      would welcome him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go back&mdash;I'll go home,&rdquo; he said. Once he would have smiled at
      the thought that he would ever call the Hue and Cry colony &ldquo;home.&rdquo;

      XXVI ~ THE FANGS OF OLD RAZEE

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     A dollar a day is a Hoosier's pay,

     Yes, a dollar a day is a Hoosier's pay,

    <p>
      Before leaving New York Mayo made inquiries at offices of shipping brokers
      and trailed Captain Zoradus Wass to his lair in the loafers' room of a
      towboat office. Their conference was a gloomy one; neither had any comfort
      for the other. Mayo was laconic in his recital of events: he said that he
      had run away&mdash;and had come back. Of Marston and Marston's daughter he
      made no mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been to see that fat whelp of a Fogg,&rdquo; stated the old master
      mariner. &ldquo;I ain't afraid of him. I had a good excuse; I said I wanted a
      job. I didn't let on to him that I advised you to slip your cable, but I
      might have curried favor with him by saying so. He seemed to be pretty
      well satisfied because you had skipped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Wass, that's the main thing I've come to talk over with you.
      Here's my ticket back home. But I feel that I ought to walk up to the
      United States marshal's office and surrender myself. And I want to ask you
      about the prospects of my getting bail. Can you help me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon if I saw you behind bars I'd do my best to get you out, son. But
      you steer away from here on a straight tack and mind your own business!
      When the United States wants you they'll come and get you&mdash;you
      needn't worry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do worry, sir! I am dodging about the streets. I expect to feel a
      hand on my shoulder every moment. I can't endure the strain of the thing!
      I don't want anybody to think I'm a sneak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As near's I can find out by nosing around a little that indictment is a
      secret one&mdash;even if it really was returned. And I'm half inclined to
      think there wasn't any indictment! Perhaps those officers were only sent
      out to get you and hold you as a witness. Fogg has been doing most of the
      talking about there being an indictment. However it is, if they don't want
      you just yet I wouldn't go up to a cell door, son, and holler and pound
      and ask to be let in. Law has quite a way of giving a man what he hollers
      for. You go away and let me do the peeking and listening for you around
      these parts. I'm collecting a little line of stuff on this water-front.
      Haven't much else to do, these days!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon my first hunch was the right one, sir!' I'll go along home. If
      you hear anybody with a badge on inquiring for me tell him I'm fishing on
      the <i>Ethel and May</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a mean job for you, son. But I guess I'd better not say anything
      about it, seeing what I have shanghaied you into.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has not been your fault or mine, what has happened, sir. I am not
      whining!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gad! I know you ain't! But get ready to growl when the right time
      comes, and keep your teeth filed! When it's our turn to bite we'll make a
      bulldog grip of it!&rdquo; He emphasized the vigor of that grip in his farewell
      handshake.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mayo did not reflect with much enthusiasm on Captain Wass's
      metaphorical summons to combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to Maquoit, the young man decided that he was more like a beaten
      dog slinking back with canine anxiety to nurse his wounds in secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      His experiences had been too dreadful and too many in the last few days to
      be separated and assimilated. He had been like a man stunned by a fall&mdash;paralyzed
      by a blow. Now the agonizing tingle of memory and despair made his
      thoughts an exquisite torture. He tried to put Alma Marston out of those
      thoughts. He did not dare to try to find a place for her in the economy of
      his affairs. However, she and he had been down to the gates of death
      together, and he realized that the experience had had its effect on her
      nature; he believed that it had developed her character as well.
      Insistently the memory of her parting words was with him, and he knew, in
      spite of his brutal and furious efforts to condemn her, that love was not
      dead and that hope still lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swung aboard the <i>Ethel and May</i> one afternoon, after he had
      waited patiently for her arrival with her fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come back to fish with you, Captain Candage, until my troubles are
      straightened out&mdash;if they ever are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage was silent, controlling some visible emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come back to be with folks who won't talk too much about those
      troubles,&rdquo; he added, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; agreed the skipper. &ldquo;Nothing is ever gained by stirring up
      trouble after it has been well cooked. Swing the pot back over the fire, I
      say, and let it simmer till it cools off of itself. I thought you would
      come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I knew they had taken away your papers. Furthermore, Polly has been
      saying that you would come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why did she think so?&rdquo; asked Mayo, in milder tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn't say why,&rdquo; admitted Captain Candage. &ldquo;Maybe women see into
      things deeper than men do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems like coming home&mdash;coming home when a man is sick and tired
      of everything in the world, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon my Polly had something like that in mind. She dropped a few hints
      that she hoped you'd come and get rested up from your troubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she has gone back to her work, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she is still on her job at Maquoit, sir&mdash;calls it her real job.
      She isn't a quitter, Polly isn't. She says they need her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the song says, 'The flowers need the sunshine and the roses need the
      dew,' that's how they need her,&rdquo; averred Oakum Otie. &ldquo;Though them Hue and
      Cry women and children can't be said to be much like roses and geraniums!
      But they're more like it than they ever was before, since Miss Polly has
      taken hold of 'em. It's wonderful what a good girl can do when she tries,
      Captain Mayo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Resuming his life on the fishing-schooner was like slipping on a pair of
      old shoes, and Mayo was grateful for that New England stoicism which had
      greeted him in such matter-of-fact fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you want to tell me is all right and what you don't want to tell me
      is still better,&rdquo; stated Captain Candage. &ldquo;Because when you ain't talking
      about it you ain't stirring it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, in that fashion, he came back into the humble life of Maquoit. There
      had been no awkwardness in his meeting with Captain Candage; it had been
      man to man, and they understood how to dispense with words. But Mayo
      looked forward to his meeting with Polly Candage without feeling that
      equanimity which the father had inspired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt an almost overmastering desire to confide to her his troubles of
      the heart. But he knew that he would not be able to do that. His little
      temple had been so cruelly profaned. His humiliation was too great.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious that some other reason was operating to hold him back
      from explaining to her; and because he did not understand just what it was
      he was ill at ease when he did come face to face with her. He was grateful
      for one circumstance&mdash;their first meeting was in the old fish-house
      at Maquoit, under the hundred curious eyes of the colony. He had rowed
      ashore in his dory and went to seek her in the midst of her activities.
      She put out both her hands and greeted him with frank pleasure and seemed
      to understand his constraint, to anticipate his own thoughts, to respect
      his reticence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you have come back to wait till all your troubles are settled.
      The most consoling friends are those who know and who sympathize and who
      keep still! Now come with me and listen to the children and see what the
      women are doing. You will be proud and glad because you spoke up for them
      that day when we went over to Hue and Cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that there was no constraint between them; they kept their own
      affairs hidden from each other. The autumn passed and the long, chill
      evenings came, and when the fishing-schooner was in port at Maquoit,
      between trips, Mayo and the girl spent comfortable hours together, playing
      at cards under the widow's red-shaded lamp and under the widow's approving
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they ain't courting, either,&rdquo; she informed the pestering neighbors.
      &ldquo;Do you suppose I have been twice married and twice a widder not to know
      courting when I see it? It's 'Boyd this' and 'Polly that,' to be sure, the
      whole continyal time; but she is engaged to somebody else, because she has
      been wearing an engagement ring that has come to her since she has been
      here. She showed it to me, and she showed it to him! And as for him,
      everybody 'longcoast knows how dead gone on him that millionaire girl is!
      Now everybody mind their own business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the days passed the widow's counsel seemed to apply to all the affairs
      of Maquoit; folks went at their business in good earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter wind nipped, the wharf piles were sheathed with ice, and only
      hardy men were abroad on the waterfront of the coast city, but the crew of
      the <i>Ethel and May</i> were unusually cheerful that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The schooner had stayed on Cashes Banks and had ridden out a gale that had
      driven other fishermen to shelter. Then in the first lull she had sent her
      dories over the rail and had put down her trawls for a set, and a rousing
      set it was! It seemed as if the cod, hake, and haddock had been waiting
      for that gale to stop so that they might hunt for baited hooks and have a
      feast. Nearly every ganging-line had its prize. The bow pulley in each
      dory fairly chuckled with delight as the trawl line was pulled over it.
      Every three feet was a ganging-line. Each dory strung out a mile of trawl.
      And when the dories returned to the schooner and dumped the catch into the
      hold the little craft fairly wallowed under her load.
    </p>
    <p>
      They caught the market bare; the gale had blown for nearly a week.
      Fish-houses bid spiritedly against one another, and when at last a trade
      was made and the schooner's crew began to pitchfork the fish into the
      winch buckets, and the buckets rose creaking out over the rail, the two
      captains went into the office of the fish-house to figure some mighty
      gratifying profits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing like luck in the fishing game, gents,&rdquo; observed the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, grit counts for something,&rdquo; stated Captain Candage. &ldquo;We've got a
      crew that ain't afraid of a little weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that's the case, there may be something for you off-coast about now
      that's better than the fishing game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; asked the old skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrecking. Seen the morning papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've had something to do besides fool with papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That new Bee line steamer, <i>Conomo</i>, has been piled up on Razee
      Reef.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One time&mdash;this last time&mdash;she hugged too close!&rdquo; snapped the
      young man. The others bent an inquiring gaze on him. But he did not
      explain. His thoughts were busy with the events of that day when the Bee
      line steamer started his troubles with Marston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paper says she's considered a total loss,&rdquo; went on the manager. &ldquo;If
      that's so, and the underwriters give her up, there ought to be some fine
      picking for men with grit. The board of survey went out to her on a tug
      this morning.&rdquo; He gave them their check, and they went aboard their
      schooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affair of the <i>Conomo</i> was not mentioned between them until they
      were at sea on their way to the eastward again. The piece of news did not
      interest Mayo at first, except as a marine disaster that had no bearing on
      his own affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage was stumping the quarter-deck, puffing at his short, black
      pipe. &ldquo;I don'no' as you feel anyways as I do about it, Captain Mayo, but
      it ain't going to be no great outset to us if we make a leg out to Razee
      and see what's going on there,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no objections,&rdquo; returned Mayo. &ldquo;But the way things are managed
      nowadays in case of wrecks, I don't see much prospect of our getting in on
      the thing in any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe not; but in case they're going to abandon her there'll be some
      grabbing, and we might as well grab with the rest of 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they can't get her off some junk concern will gamble on her. But we'll
      make an excursion of it to see the sights, sir. We can afford a little
      trip after what we pulled down to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no hope of reaching the wreck before nightfall, so they jogged
      comfortably in the light westerly that had succeeded the gale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage took the first watch after the second dog-watch, and at
      two bells, or nine o'clock, in the evening, Mayo awoke and heard him give
      orders to &ldquo;pinch her.&rdquo; He heard the sails flap, and knew that the men were
      shortening in readiness to lay to. He slipped on his outer clothing and
      went on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're here,&rdquo; stated the old skipper, &ldquo;and it looks like some other
      moskeeters had got here ahead of us, ready to stick in their little bills
      when they get a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a clear night, brilliant with stars. In contrast with the twinkling
      and pure lights of the heavens, there were dim reds and greens and
      yellow-white lights on the surface of the ocean. These lights rocked and
      oscillated and tossed as the giant surges swept past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make out half a dozen sail&mdash;little fellers&mdash;and two tugs,&rdquo;
       said Captain Candage. &ldquo;But get your eye on the main squeeze!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo looked in the direction of the extended mittened hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some iceberg, hey?&rdquo; commented the skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short half-mile away, a veritable ghost ship, loomed the wrecked <i>Conomo</i>.
      Spray had beaten over her and had congealed until she seemed like a mass
      of ice that had been molded into the shape of a ship. She gleamed, a
      spectral figure, under the starry heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      A single red light, a baleful blob of color, showed from her main rigging.
    </p>
    <p>
      They surveyed her for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say she was spoke for,&rdquo; was Captain Candage's opinion. &ldquo;It's
      high tide now, and a spring tide at that, and them tugs is just loafing
      out there&mdash;ain't making a move to start her. We can tell more about
      the prospect in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the two captains turned in, for the <i>Ethel and May</i> lay to
      docilely with a single helmsman at the wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crisp light of morning did not reveal anything especially new or
      important. There were half a dozen small schooners, fishermen, loafing
      under shortened canvas in the vicinity of the wreck. One of the tugs
      departed shoreward after a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo had assured himself, through the schooner's telescope, that the
      remaining tug was named <i>Seba J. Ransom</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The captain of that fellow went mate with me on a fishing-steamer once,&rdquo;
       he informed Captain Candage. &ldquo;Jockey me down in reaching distance and I'll
      go aboard him in a dory. He may have some news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Dodge was immensely pleased to see his old chum, and called him up
      into the pilot-house and gave him a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only a loafing job,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I've got to stand by and take off her
      captain and crew in case of rough weather or anything breaks loose more'n
      what's already busted. They are still hanging by her so as to deliver her
      to the buyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buyer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep! To whatever junkman is fool enough to bid her in. She's stuck fast.
      Underwriters have gone back on that tug, and are going to auction her. I'm
      here to help keep off pirates and take her men ashore after she has been
      handed over. You a pirate, Mayo?&rdquo; he asked, with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm almost anything nowadays, if there's a dollar to be made,&rdquo; returned
      the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Ransom's</i> captain gave him a wink. &ldquo;I'm on to what happened on
      board the <i>Olenia</i>&rdquo; he confided. &ldquo;Feller who was in the crew told me.
      You're good enough for old Marston's girl. Why haven't you gone up to New
      York and taken&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut that conversation, Dodge,&rdquo; barked Mayo, his face hard and his jaw
      jutting threateningly. &ldquo;Good day!&rdquo; added the young man, slamming the
      pilot-house door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His schooner, standing off and on, picked him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no use hanging around here,&rdquo; he informed the old skipper.
      &ldquo;They're going to junk her, if they can find anybody fool enough to bid.
      She'll be guarded till after the auction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Therefore the <i>Ethel and May</i> shook out all her canvas and headed
      full and by for Maquoit to secure her fresh supply of bait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a shame,&rdquo; mourned Captain Candage, staring over the taffrail at the
      ice-sheathed steamer. &ldquo;'Most new, and cost two hundred and fifty thousand
      dollars to build, if I remember right what the paper said when she was
      launched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she was making money they'll have another one in her place,&rdquo; said
      Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don'no' about that, sir. The Bee line wasn't none too strong financially,
      I'm told&mdash;a lot of little fellers who put in what they could scrape
      and borrowed the rest. Depends on insurance and their courage what they do
      after this.&rdquo; He offered another observation after he had tamped down a
      load in his black pipe. &ldquo;Men will do 'most anything for money&mdash;enough
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems as if I'd heard that statement before,&rdquo; was Mayo's curt rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know it ain't in any ways new. But the more I think over what has
      happened to the <i>Conomo</i>, the pickeder seems the point to that
      remark. And whilst I was standing off and on, waiting for you, I run close
      enough to that steamer to make out a few faces aboard her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo glanced at him without comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F'r instance, I saw Art Simpson. You know him, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was captain of Mr. Marston's yacht once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did he leave her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard he had been discharged. That was what the broker said when he
      hired me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's what Simpson said. He made a business of going around and
      swearing about it. Seemed to want to have everybody 'longcoast hear him
      swear about it. When I see a man make too much of a business of swearing
      about another man I get suspicious. After Art Simpson worked his cards so
      as to get the job of second officer on board the new <i>Conomo</i> I got
      <i>more</i> suspicious. Now that I have seen how that steamer has been
      plunked fair and square on Razee, I'm <i>almighty</i> suspicious. I'm
      suspicious enough to believe that she banged during Art Simpson's watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you driving at, Captain Candage? Are you hinting that anybody
      would plant a man for a job of that kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly what I'm hinting,&rdquo; drawled the skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But putting a steamer on the rocks at this time of year!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No passengers&mdash;and plenty of life-boats for the crew, sir. I have
      been hearing a lot of talk about steamboat conditions since I have been
      carrying in fish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've found out a little something in that line myself,&rdquo; admitted Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's one thing to be said about Blackbeard and Cap'n Teach and old Cap
      Kidd&mdash;they went out on the sea and tended to their own pirating; they
      didn't stay behind a desk and send out understrappers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo, in spite of his bitter memories of Julius Mar-ston's attitude, felt
      impelled to palliate in some degree the apparent enormities of the
      steamboat magnates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe the big fellows know all that's done, Captain Candage. As
      responsible parties they wouldn't dare to have those things done. The
      understrappers, as you say, are anxious to make good and to earn their
      money, and when the word is passed on down to 'em they go at the job
      recklessly. I think it will be pretty hard to fix anything on the real
      principals. That's why I am out in the cold with my hands tied, just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we were going to get into the <i>Conomo</i> matter a little, so
      that we could do some first-hand scouting. It looks to me like the rankest
      job to date, and it may be the opening for a general overhauling. When
      deviltry gets to running too hard it generally stubs its toes, sir.&rdquo;
       Captain Candage found a responsive gleam in Mayo's eyes and he went on.
      &ldquo;Of course, I didn't hear the talk, nor see the money pass, nor I wa'n't
      in the pilot-house when Art Simpson shut his eyes and let her slam. But
      having been a sailorman all my life, I smell nasty weather a long ways
      off. That steamer was wrecked a-purpose, and she was wrecked at a time o'
      year when she can't be salvaged. You don't have to advise the devil how to
      build a bonfire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo did not offer any comment. He seemed to be much occupied by his
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later a newspaper came into Mayo's hands at Maquoit, and he read
      that the wrecked steamer had been put up at auction by the underwriters.
      It was plain that the bidders had shared the insurance folks' general
      feeling of pessimism&mdash;she had been knocked down for two thousand five
      hundred dollars. The newspapers explained that only this ridiculous sum
      had been realized because experts had decided that in the first blow the
      steamer would slip off the ledges on which she was impaled and would go
      down like a plummet in the deep water from which old Razee cropped. Even
      the most reckless of gambling junkmen could not be expected to dare much
      of an investment in such a peek-a-boo game as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wonder what was the matter with the expert who predicted that,&rdquo;
       mused Mayo. &ldquo;He doesn't know the old jaw teeth of Razee Reef as well as I
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the <i>Ethel and May</i> set forth from Maquoit on her next trip to
      Cashes Banks, Mayo suggested&mdash;and he was a bit shamefaced when he did
      so&mdash;that they might as well go out of their way a little and see what
      the junkers were doing at Razee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage eyed his associate with rather quizzical expression.
      &ldquo;Great minds travel, et cetry!&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;I was just going to say that
      same thing to you. On your mind a little, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and only a little. Of course, there can't be anything in it for us.
      Those junkers will stick to her till she ducks for deep water. But I've
      been wondering why they think she's going to duck. I seined around Razee
      for a while, and the old chap has teeth like a hyena&mdash;regular fangs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe they took Art Simpson's say-so,&rdquo; remarked the old man, wrinkling
      his nose. &ldquo;Art would be very encouraging about the prospects of saving her&mdash;that
      is to say, he would be so in case losing that steamer has turned his
      brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess there wasn't very much interest by the underwriters,&rdquo; suggested
      Mayo. &ldquo;They weren't stuck very hard, so I've found out. She was mostly
      owned in sixty-fourths, and with marine risks up to where they are, small
      owners don't insure. It's a wicked thing all through, Candage! That great,
      new steamer piled up there by somebody's devilishness! I believe as you do
      about the affair! I've been to sea so long that a boat means something to
      me besides iron and wood. There's something about 'em&mdash;something&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost human,&rdquo; put in the old man. &ldquo;I sorrowed over the <i>Polly</i>, but
      I didn't feel as bad as if she'd been new. It was sort of like when old
      folks die of natural causes&mdash;you know they have lived about as long
      as they can. It's sorrowful to have 'em go, but you have to feel
      reconciled. But I know just how it is with you in the case of that
      steamer, for I'm a sailor like you. It's just like getting a fine boy
      through college, seeing him start out full of life, and courage, and
      hopes, and prospects, and then seeing him drop dead at your feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a quaver in the old man's tones. But Mayo, who knew the souls of
      mariners, understood. Under their hard shells there is imagination that
      has been nurtured in long, long thoughts. In the calms under starlit
      skies, in the black darkness when tossing surges swing beneath the keel,
      in the glimmering vistas of sun-lighted seas, sailors ponder while their
      more stolid brothers on land allow their souls to doze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Captain Candage. That's why I almost hate to go out to the
      <i>Conomo</i>. Those infernal ghouls of junkmen will be tearing her into
      bits instead of trying to put the breath of life back into her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The helpless steamer seemed more lonely than when they had visited her
      before. The mosquito fleet that had surrounded her, hoping for some stray
      pickings, had dispersed. A tug and a couple of lighters were stuck against
      her icy sides, and, like leeches, were sucking from her what they could.
      They were prosecuting their work industriously, for the sea was calm in
      one of those lulls between storms, a wintry truce that Atlantic coastwise
      toilers understand and depend on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo, his curiosity prompting him, determined to go on board one of the
      lighters and discover to what extremes the junk jackals were proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of his dorymen ferried him after the schooner had been hove to near
      the wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's your business?&rdquo; inquired a man who was bundled in a fur coat and
      seemed to be bossing operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing much,&rdquo; confessed the young man from his dory, which was tossing
      alongside the lighter. &ldquo;I'm only a fisherman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The swinging cranes of the lighters, winches purring, the little
      lifting-engines puffing in breathless staccato, were hoisting and dropping
      cargo&mdash;potatoes in sacks, and huge rolls of print paper. Mayo was a
      bit astonished to note that they were not stripping the steamer; not even
      her anchors and chains had been disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fend off!&rdquo; commanded the boss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Dodge dropped one of the windows of his pilot-house and leaned on
      his elbows, thrusting his head out. The tug <i>Seba J. Ransom</i> was
      still on the job. She was tied up alongside the wreck, chafing her fenders
      against the ice-sheathed hull.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Captain Mayo!&rdquo; he called, a welcoming grin splitting his features.
      &ldquo;Come aboard and have a cigar, and this time I'll keep the conversation on
      fish-scales and gurry-butts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man in the fur coat glanced from one to the other, and was promptly
      placated. &ldquo;Oh, this is a friend of yours, is he, Captain Dodge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet he is. He's been my boss before now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that's the case make yourself at home anywhere. But you know what some
      of these fellows alongcoast who call themselves fishermen will do around a
      wreck when your back is turned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo nodded amicably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step on board,&rdquo; invited the boss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm all right here in the dory, and I'm out from underfoot, sir. We're
      going along to the fishing-grounds in a jiffy. I'm only satisfying a
      sailor's curiosity. Wondered what you intended to do with this
      proposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're only grabbing what's handy just now. Some of the cargo forward is
      above water. I'm in on this thing in a sort of queer way myself.&rdquo; This
      keen-eyed young man who had been so heartily indorsed by the tugboat
      skipper afforded the man in the fur coat an opportunity for a little
      conversation about himself. &ldquo;I'm the outside man for Todd &amp; Simonton,
      of Boston, and bought on the jump after I'd swapped a wire or so with the
      house. Happened into that auction, and bought blind. I believe in a gamble
      myself. Then somebody wired to the concern that they had been stuck good
      and fine, and they gave me a sizzler of a call-down in a night message. A
      man can sit at desk in Boston and think up a whole lot of things that
      ain't so. Well, I've flown out here with what equipment I could scrape up
      in a hurry, and you can see what I'm doing! There's enough in sight in the
      way of loose cargo to square me with the concern. But, blast the luck! If
      Jake Simonton had a little grit and would back me I believe we'd make a
      killing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, it all depends on how she's resting and what will happen when
      the next blow comes,&rdquo; said Mayo. &ldquo;Have you been below?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a hustler on a dicker, and a hellion on junk,&rdquo; snapped the boss. &ldquo;I'm
      no sailor, prophet, or marine architect. I simply know that she's full of
      water aft and has got something serious the matter with her innards. I'm
      pulling enough out to make Simonton sorry he sassed me in a night message.
      Only he will never let on that he's sorry. He never lets loose any
      boomerangs that will scale around and come back and hit him. He wants to
      be in a position to rasp me the next time I make a mistake in a gamble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the crew gone ashore&mdash;the Bee line men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure&mdash;bag and baggage. We own her as she stands. That second officer
      had 'em shivering every time a wave slapped her. I was glad when he got
      away. He pretty nigh stampeded <i>my</i> men. Said she was liable to slide
      any minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The drawling voice of Captain Dodge broke in above them. &ldquo;Here comes the
      tug <i>Resolute</i>&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;Mebbe it's another one of them night
      messages from your concern, Titus. May want you to put what you can carry
      of her in a paper bag and bring it to Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never can tell what they're going to do in Boston,&rdquo; growled the
      outside man. &ldquo;I get discouraged, sometimes, trying to be enterprising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to pace, looking worried, and did not reply to several questions
      that Mayo put to him. So the young man accepted Captain Dodge's invitation
      and climbed to the tugboat's pilot-house. He had a very human hankering to
      know what the coming of that tug from the main signified, and decided to
      hang around a little while longer, even at the risk of making Captain
      Candage impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Resolute</i> brought a telegram, and the man in the fur coat
      slapped it open, took in its gist at one glance, and began to swear with
      great gusto.
    </p>
    <p>
      He climbed into the <i>Ransom's</i> pilot-house, with the air of a man
      seeking comfort from friends, and fanned the sheet of paper wrathfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orders to resell. Get out from under. Take what I can get. Don't want the
      gamble. And here I have cleaned a good profit already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you fire back a message advising 'em to hold on?&rdquo; asked Captain
      Dodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have a gale come up in a few hours and knock her off'n this rock?
      That's what would happen. It would be just my luck. I'm only a hired man,
      gents. If my firm won't gamble, it ain't up to me. If I disobey orders and
      hold on, I'll be scared to death the first time the wind begins to blow.
      There's no use in ruining a fine set of nerves for a firm that won't
      appreciate the sacrifice, and I need nerve to keep on working for 'em. I
      say it ain't up to me. Me for shore as soon as I load those lighters.
      Every dollar I get by reselling is velvet, so let 'ergo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they tell you to do about price?&rdquo; ventured Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the first offer&mdash;and hurry about it. They seem to have an idea
      that this steamer is standing on her head on the point of a needle, and
      that only a blind man will buy her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went back to his crew, much disgusted, ordered the freshly arrived tug
      to wait for a tow, and spurred laggard toilers with sharp profanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody has been scaring his concern,&rdquo; suggested Mayo, left alone with
      Captain Dodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so&mdash;but it may be good business to get scared, provided they
      can unload this onto somebody else for a little ready cash. This spell of
      weather can't last much longer. Look at that bank to s'uthard. I don't
      know just what is under her in the way of ledges&mdash;never knew much
      about old Razee. But my prediction is, she'll break in two as soon as the
      waves give her any motion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was on the tip of Mayo's tongue to argue the matter with the tugboat
      man, but he took second thought and shut his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're probably right,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I'd better be moving. I don't see
      any fish jumping aboard our schooner. We've got to go and catch 'em.
      Good-by, Dodge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When his associate came in over the rail of the <i>Ethel and May</i>
      Captain Candage, from force of habit, having picked up his men, gave
      orders to let her off into the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold her all-aback!&rdquo; commanded Mayo. &ldquo;Excuse me, Captain Candage, for a
      cross-order, but I've got a bit of news I want you to hear before we
      leave. The junk crowd has got cold feet and are going to sell as she
      stands, as soon as they get cargoes for those lighters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she does lay in a bad way, and weather is making,&rdquo; said the
      skipper, fiddling his forefinger under his nose dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They haven't even skimmed the cream off her&mdash;probably will get all
      her cargo that's worth saving and some loose stuff in the rigging line. By
      gad! what a chance for a gamble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be for a feller who had so much money he could kiss a slice of
      it good-by in case the Atlantic Ocean showed aces,&rdquo; said the old man,
      revealing a sailor's familiarity with a popular game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is such a thing as being desperate enough to stake your whole
      bundle,&rdquo; declared Mayo. &ldquo;Captain, I'm young, and I suppose I have got a
      young man's folly. I can't expect you to feel the way I feel about a
      gamble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may look old, but I haven't gone to seed yet,&rdquo; grumbled the skipper.
      &ldquo;What are you trying to get through you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fat man on that lighter has a telegram in his pocket from his folks
      in Boston, ordering him to take the first offer that is made for the <i>Conomo</i>
      as she stands. I'm fool enough to be willing to put in every dollar I've
      got, and take a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage stared at his associate for a time, and then walked to the
      rail and took a long look at the steamer. &ldquo;I never heard of a feller ever
      getting specially rich in the fishing game,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo, wild thoughts urging him to desperate ventures, snapped out
      corroboration of that dictum..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I've known a lot of fellers to go broke in the wrecking game,&rdquo;
       pursued Captain Candage. &ldquo;How much have you got?&rdquo; That question came
      unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got rising six hundred dollars.&rdquo; He was carrying his little hoard in
      his pocket, for a man operating from the hamlet of Maquoit must needs be
      his own banker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got rising six hundred in my own pocket,&rdquo; said the skipper. &ldquo;That
      fat man may have orders to take the first offer that's made, but we've got
      to make him one that's big enough so that he won't kick us overboard and
      then go hunt up a buyer on the main.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two Hue and Cry fishermen who had ferried the young man were nesting
      their dory on top of other dories, and just forward of the house, and were
      within hearing. Neither captain noted with what interest these men were
      listening, exchanging glances with the man at the wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after we waggle our wad under his nose&mdash;and less than a thousand
      will be an insult, so I figger&mdash;what have we got left to operate
      with? It won't do us any good to sail round that steamer for the rest of
      the winter and admire her. What was you thinking, Mayo, of trying to work
      him for a snap bargain, now that he's here on the spot and anxious to
      sell, and then grabbing off a little quick profit by peddling her to
      somebody else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; cried the young man, with decision. &ldquo;I've got my own good
      reasons for wanting to make this job the whole hog or not a bristle! I
      won't go into it on any other plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'll be into something, all right, after we invest our money&mdash;the
      whole lump. We'll most likely be in a scrape, not a dollar left to hire
      men or buy wrecking outfit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men finished lashing the dories and went forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a wild scheme, and I'm a fool to be thinking about it, Captain
      Candage. But wild schemes appeal to me just now. I can make some more
      money by working hard and saving it, a few dollars at a time, but I never
      expect to see another chance like this. Oh yes, I see that bank in the
      south!&rdquo; His eyes followed the skipper's gloomy stare. &ldquo;By to-morrow at
      this time she may be forty fathoms under. But here's the way I feel.&rdquo; He
      pulled out his wallet and slapped it down on the roof of the house. &ldquo;All
      on the turn of one card! And there comes the blow that will turn it!&rdquo; He
      pointed south into the slaty clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Candage paused in his patrol of the quarterdeck and gazed down on
      the wallet. Then he began to tug at his own. &ldquo;I'm no dead one, even if my
      hair is gray,&rdquo; he grumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two captains looked at the two wallets, and then at each other. The
      next moment their attention was fully taken up by another matter. Their
      crew of fifteen men came marching aft and lined up forward of the house. A
      spokesman stepped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse us, captings, for meddling into something that p'raps ain't none
      of our business. We ain't meaning to peek nor pry, but some of us couldn't
      help overhearing. We've cleaned out our pockets. Here it is&mdash;three
      hundred and sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents. Will you let me
      step onto the quarter-deck and lay it down 'side of them wallets?&rdquo; He
      accepted their amazed silence as consent, and made his deposit solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is all a gamble, and a mighty uncertain one,&rdquo; protested Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We 'ain't never had no chance to be sports before in all our lives,&rdquo;
       pleaded the man. &ldquo;We wouldn't have had that money if you two heroes hadn't
      give us the chance you have. We wa'n't more'n half men before. Now we can
      hold up our heads. You'll make us feel mighty mean, as if we wasn't fit to
      be along with you, if you won't let us in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet you can come in, boys!&rdquo; shouted Captain Candage. &ldquo;I know how you
      feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And another thing,&rdquo; went on the spokesman. &ldquo;We 'ain't had much time to
      talk this over; we rushed aft here as soon as we heard and had cleaned out
      our pockets. But we've said enough to each other so that we can tell you
      that all of us will turn to on that wreck with you and work for nothing
      till&mdash;till&mdash;well, whatever happens. Don't want wages! Don't need
      promises! And if she sinks, we'll sing a song and go back to fishing
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man at the wheel let go the spokes and came forward and deposited a
      handful of money beside the rest. &ldquo;There's mine. I wisht it was a million;
      it would go just as free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, I'd make a speech to you&mdash;but my throat is too full,&rdquo; choked
      Mayo. &ldquo;I know better, now, why something called me over to Hue and Cry
      last summer. Hard over with that wheel! Jockey her down toward the wreck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they were within hailing distance of the lighter Mayo raised his
      megaphone. &ldquo;Will you take fifteen hundred dollars&mdash;cash&mdash;now&mdash;for
      that wreck, as you leave her when you've loaded those lighters?&rdquo; he
      shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long period of silence. Then the man in the fur coat replied,
      through his hollowed hands: &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and blast the fools in Boston who
      are making me sell!&rdquo;

      XXVII ~ THE TEMPEST TURNS ITS CARD
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     And one thing which we have to crave,
     Is that he may have a watery grave.
     So well heave him down into some dark hole,
     Where the sharks 'll have his body and the devil have his soul.
          With a big bow wow!
               Tow row row!
          Pal de, rai de, ri do day!
                             &mdash;Boston.
</pre>
    <p>
      After the man in the fur coat had placed a hastily executed bill of sale
      in Mayo's hands, he frankly declared that his interest in the fortune of
      the wrecked steamer had ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Resolute reports that storm signals are displayed. I'll simply make
      sure of what I've got. I'll play the game as those quitters in Boston seem
      to want me to play it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tugs, departing with their tows, squalled salutes to the little
      schooner hove to under the counter of the <i>Conomo</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds like they was making fun of us,&rdquo; growled Candage. He scowled into
      the gray skies and across the lonely sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo, too, sensed a derisive note in the whistle-toots. Depression had
      promptly followed the excitement that had spurred him into this venture.
      The crackle of the legal paper in his reefer pocket only accentuated his
      gloom. That paper seemed to represent so little now. It was not merely his
      own gamble&mdash;he had drawn into a desperate undertaking men who could
      not afford to lose. They had put all their little prosperity in jeopardy.
      There were women and children ashore to consider. He and his fellows now
      owned that great steamer which loomed there under the brooding heavens.
      But it was a precarious possession. The loss of her now would mean not
      merely the loss of all their little hoards&mdash;it would mean the loss of
      hope, and the sacrifice of expectations, and the regret of men who have
      failed in a big task. He realized how stinging would be defeat, for he was
      building the prospects of his future upon winning in this thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope almost failed to reassure him as he gazed first at the departing
      lighters and then at the ice-panoplied hulk on Razee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely no pauper ever had a more unwieldy elephant on his hands, without a
      wisp of hay in sight for food.. He had seen wrecking operations: money,
      men, and gigantic equipment often failed to win. Technical skill and
      expert knowledge were required. He did not know what an examination of her
      hull would reveal. He had bought as boys swap jack-knives&mdash;sight
      denied! He confessed to himself that even the pittance they had gambled on
      this hazard had been spent with the recklessness of folly, considering
      that they had spent their all. They had nothing left to operate with. It
      was like a man tying his hands behind him before he jumped overboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, that was a lonely sea! It was gray and surly and ominous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black smoke from the distant tugs waved dismal farewell. A chill wind had
      begun to harp through the cordage of the little schooner; the moan&mdash;far
      flung, mystic, a voice from nowhere&mdash;that presages the tempest
      crooned in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can smell something in this weather that's worse than scorched-on hasty
      pudding,&rdquo; stated Captain Can-dage. &ldquo;I don't know just how you feel, sir,
      but if a feller should ride up here in a hearse about now and want my
      option on her for what I paid, I believe I'd dicker with him before we
      come to blows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't blame you,&rdquo; confessed the young man. &ldquo;This seems to be another
      case of 'Now that we've got it, what the devil shall we do with it?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's pile ashore on the trail of them lighters and dicker it, and be
      sensible,&rdquo; advised his associate. &ldquo;I feel as if I owned a share in old
      Poppocatterpettul&mdash;or whatever that mountain is&mdash;and had been
      ordered to move it in a shawl-strap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo surveyed their newly acquired property through the advancing dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I know a feller we can unload onto,&rdquo; persisted Candage. &ldquo;He has
      done some wrecking, and is a reckless cuss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; snapped his associate, &ldquo;we'll settle one point right now,
      sir. I'm not hurrahing over this prospect&mdash;not at all. But I'm in it,
      and I'm going to stick on my original plan. I don't want anybody in with
      me who is going to keep looking back and whining. If everything goes by
      the board, you won't hear a whicker out of me. If you want to quit now,
      Captain Candage, go ahead, and I'll mortgage my future to pay back what
      you have risked. Now what do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I say you're talking just the way I like to hear a man talk,&rdquo;
       declared the skipper, stoutly. &ldquo;I'll be cursed if I like to go into a
      thing with any half-hearted feller. You're <i>my</i> kind, and after this
      you'll find me <i>your</i> kind.&rdquo; He turned and shouted commands. &ldquo;Get in
      mains'l, close reef fores'l, and let her ride with that and jumbo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the idea!&rdquo; commended Mayo. &ldquo;The Atlantic Ocean is getting ready to
      deal a hand in this game. We have got to stick close if we're going to see
      what cards we draw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fishing-schooner, if well handled, is a veritable stormy petrel in
      riding out a blow. Even the ominous signs of tempest did not daunt the two
      captains. They were there to guard their property and to have their hopes
      or their fears realized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the <i>Conomo</i> has got her grit with her and lives through it,&rdquo;
       said Captain Candage, &ldquo;we'll be here to give her three cheers when it's
      over. And if she goes down we'll be on deck to flap her a fare-ye-well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In that spirit they snugged everything on board the schooner and prepared
      to defy the storm. It came in the night, with a howl of blast and a
      fusillade of sleet like bird-shot. It stamped upon the throbbing sea and
      made tumult in water and air. At midnight they were wallowing with only a
      forestays'l that was iced to the hardness of boiler plate. But though the
      vast surges flung their mighty arms in efforts to grasp the schooner, she
      dodged and danced on her nimble way and frustrated their malignity. Her
      men did not sleep; they thawed themselves in relays and swarmed on deck
      again. Each seemed to be animated by personal and vital interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't buy crews like this one with wages,&rdquo; observed Captain Candage,
      icicled beard close to Mayo's ear. &ldquo;I reckon it was about as my Polly said&mdash;you
      cast bread on the waters when you took their part on Hue and Cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man, clinging to a cleat and watching the struggles of their
      craft, waved a mittened hand to signify that he agreed. In that riot of
      tempest and ruck of sea he was straining his eyes, trying to get a glimpse
      of the hulk on Razee. But the schooner had worked her way too far off to
      the west, pressed to leeward by the relentless palm of the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then at last came morning, an opaque dawn that was shrouded with swirling
      snow, and all was hidden from their eyes except the tumbling mountains of
      water which swept to them, threatened to engulf them, and then melted
      under their keel. The captains could only guess at the extent of their
      drift, but when the wind quieted after midday, and they were able to get
      sail on the schooner, they were in no doubt as to the direction in which
      the steamer must lie. They began their sloshing ratch back to east.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo braved nipping wind and iced rigging and took the glass to the main
      crosstrees. He remained there though he was chilled through and through.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, near the horizon's rim, he spied a yeasty tumult of the sea,
      marking some obstruction at which the waves were tussling. In the midst of
      this white welter there was a shape that was almost spectral under the
      gray skies. The little schooner pitched so ferociously that only
      occasionally could he bring this object into the range of the glass. But
      he made sure at last. He clutched the glass and tobogganed to deck down
      the slippery shrouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's there, Captain Candage!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;The teeth of old Razee are
      still biting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were back to her again before the early night descended. She was iced
      to the main truck, and the spray had deposited hillocks of ice on her
      deck, weighting her down upon the ledges which had pinioned her. But in
      spite of the battering she had received her position had not changed. They
      circled her&mdash;the midget of a schooner seeming pitifully inadequate to
      cope with this monster craft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; sighed Captain Candage, &ldquo;thank the Lord she's still here. Our work
      is cut out for us now&mdash;whatever it is we can do with her. They say a
      mouse set a lion loose once by gnawing his ropes. It looks to me as if
      we're going to have some blasted slow gnawing here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They lay by her that night in a quieting sea, and spent wakeful hours in
      the cabin, struggling rather helplessly with schemes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, it's comforting to find her here and to know that the Atlantic
      Ocean will have to get more muscle to move her,&rdquo; said Candage. &ldquo;And then
      again, it ain't so darnation comforting. Looks to me as if she's stuck
      there so solid that you couldn't joggle her off if you hove the moon at
      her. I reckon my hope has been what yours has been, Mayo&mdash;salvage her
      whole instead of junking her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a sailor, not a junkman. I'd almost rather let my money go, Captain
      Candage, than be a party to smashing up that new steamer into old iron.
      She has fooled the guessers by sticking where she is. It has been my hope
      from the first that she can be floated. She is not a rusted old iron
      rattletrap. Of course, she's got a hole in her, and we can see now that
      she's planted mighty solid. But she is sound and tight, I'll wager, in all
      her parts except where that wound is. I suppose most men who came along
      here now would guess that she can't be got off whole. I'm going into this
      thing and try to fool <i>those</i> guessers, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the only real gamble,&rdquo; agreed the skipper. &ldquo;We'd only make days'
      wages by carving her into a junk-pile. A scrap-heap ain't worth much
      except as old iron at half a cent a pound; but a new steamer like that is
      worth two hundred thousand dollars, by gorry! if she's afloat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we've got to do something besides lay to here and look at her
      lines. In the first place, I want to know what's the matter with her&mdash;about
      how much of a hole she has got. Our eyes ought to tell us a little
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And on that errand Mayo departed the next morning after breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a sailor, young, alert, and bold, could have scaled the side of the
      steamer in that weather. Her ladder was in place, but nothing much except
      an exaggerated icicle. But it was on the lee side of her, and his dory was
      fairly well protected from the rush of the seas. With his hatchet he
      hacked foothold on the ladder, left his men in the dory, and notched his
      perilous way to the deck. The fore-hatch was open, just as the hastily
      departing salvagers had left it. He went below, down the frosted iron
      ladder. He was fronted with a cheerless aspect. Cargo and water hid what
      damage she had suffered. The fat man had secured most of the cargo that
      the water had not ruined.
    </p>
    <p>
      He climbed back on deck and explored amidships and aft. Her engine-room
      was partially flooded, for her forepeak was propped on the higher part of
      the reef, and water had settled aft. Her crew's quarters were above the
      main-deck, as is the case with most cargo-carriers of the newer type. He
      found plenty of tinned food in the steward's domains, coal in tie galley
      bunker, and there was bedding in the officers' staterooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo scrambled back to his dory and went aboard the schooner. He reported
      his findings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here's the only sensible plan for the present, Captain Candage: I'll
      take two men and a dory and go aboard and guard our property. Somebody
      must stay here&mdash;and I don't want you to take the chances on that
      wreck. You've got a daughter. You probably know more of the shipyard crowd
      in Limeport than I do. That's the nearest city, and I believe that when
      you report that the <i>Conomo</i> is holding after this storm you can hire
      some equipment on credit and borrow some money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear I'll do my best. I know a lot of water-front folks, and I've
      always paid my bills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We need stuff for the whole wrecking game&mdash;engine, pumps, and all
      the rest. You go and scout on shore and capture a few men and bring 'em
      out here to look our prospect over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Offer 'em a lay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. We'll make this a close corporation. I don't propose to let a
      lot of land sharks in here to manipulate us out of what's our own. It's
      our gamble, and we want what's coming out of it. Go ashore and see what
      you can do on prices and terms. Don't close anything till you and I have
      conferred. I'll have a schedule of needs made up by the time you're back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later he was located on the wreck with the two men he had
      selected as his companions. They carried tackle with them, with which they
      hoisted after them their dory&mdash;their main bower in case of emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the sea which Mayo surveyed was more lonely than ever, for the <i>Ethel
      and May</i> was standing off across the heaving surface toward the main
      and the hulk was left alone in the expanse of ocean. He felt very much of
      a pygmy and very helpless as he scrambled about over the icy decks. He
      remembered that faith can move mountains, but he was as yet unable to
      determine just what power would be able to move that steamer, into whose
      vitals the reef of Razee had poked its teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight bells, midnight, Mayo turned out of his berth, for he heard
      something that interested him. It was a soft pattering, a gentle swishing.
      As a mariner, he knew how sudden can be meteorological changes on the
      coast in winter. When the north winds have raged and howled and have blown
      themselves out, spitting sleet and snow, the gentler south winds have
      their innings and bear balmier moisture from the Gulf Stream. He poked his
      head out and felt a soft air and warm rain. He had been hoping and half
      expecting that a change of weather would bring this condition&mdash;known
      as a January thaw. He went back to his bunk, much comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bright sun awoke him. Clear skies had succeeded the rain, All was
      dripping and melting. Chunks of ice were dropping from the steamer's
      stubby masts, and her scuppers were beginning to discharge water from the
      softening mass on her deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and his little crew ate breakfast with great good cheer, then secured
      axes from the steamer's tool-house and began to chop watercourses in the
      ice. A benignant sun in a cloudless sky had enlisted himself as a member
      of the wrecking crew on Razee Reef. That weather would soon clear the <i>Conomo</i>
      of her sheathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a cheerful prospect, because rigging and deck equipment of
      various kinds would be released. The steamer began to look like a less
      discouraging proposition. She was no longer the icicle that had put a
      chill into underwriters and bidders. Mayo lost the somberness that had
      weighed upon him. The sea did not seem so lonely and so threatening. He
      felt that he could show something tangible and hopeful to the parties whom
      Captain Can-dage might be able to solicit.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he saw a tug approaching in the afternoon his optimism suggested that
      it brought the skipper and his party; his own hopes were so high now that
      he felt that men with equipment and money would be eager to loan it to
      parties who possessed such excellent prospects. In this fashion he
      translated this apparent haste to get to the reef.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not Captain Candage who hailed him when the tug eased herself
      against the ladder, her screw churning the sea in reverse. A stranger came
      out of the pilothouse of the <i>Resolute</i>, carrying a big leather
      suit-case. He was plainly the passenger who had chartered her. A deck-hand
      tossed a cast-line to the steamer's deck, and Mayo promptly threw it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't come aboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who says so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say so. I have a bill of sale of her in my pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't recognize it. The law will have something to say about that
      later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care what the law may say later. I'm talking right now. We own
      this steamer. What are you here for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left quite a lot of little personal belongings on her. I went away in a
      hurry. I want to come aboard with this valise and get 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must be pretty valuable belongings, seeing that you've chartered a
      tug to come out here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fellow's own property means more to him than it does to anybody else.
      Now that I've gone to all this expense, you ain't mean enough are you, to
      keep me off? This is between sailors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated. &ldquo;Well, if I've got to be introduced I'll say my name is
      Simpson&mdash;I have been second officer aboard there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not here with any legal papers&mdash;you're not trying any trick
      to get possession, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take all in hearing to witness that I ain't! I'll pick up my stuff and
      leave in ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come aboard, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man set down his suit-case and hitched a heave-line to the handle. He
      coiled the line and handed it to a deck-hand. &ldquo;Throw that to me when I'm
      on deck,&rdquo; he ordered. Then he came up the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heave, and I'll hoist up the bag,&rdquo; suggested Mayo at the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till I get there,&rdquo; barked the visitor, still climbing. He caught the
      line after he had reached the rail and pulled up the case with some effort
      and great care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, that bag isn't empty,&rdquo; said Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said it was? I'm carrying around in it all I own in the world. I'm
      starting for New York as soon as this tug sets me ashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He picked up the case and started for the officers' quarters. Mayo went
      along, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You afraid I'm going to steal her engine out of her? The few little
      things of mine I'm after were hidden away, and that's how I forgot 'em.
      Now don't insult me by following me around as if I was a thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know just what you are,&rdquo; muttered the young man. &ldquo;There's
      something that looks mighty phony about this, but I haven't got you sized
      up just yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go back&mdash;go back right now. I supposed I was asking a favor of
      a gentleman and a brother officer.&rdquo; He started on his return to the
      ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go get your stuff,&rdquo; commanded Mayo. &ldquo;If your business here is all your
      own, I don't want to spy on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went back to question the captain of the tug for information in regard
      to the <i>Ethel and May</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's in Limeport,&rdquo; reported the captain, elbows on his window-sill.
      &ldquo;Came past her in the inner harbor this morning. You've bit off quite a
      chunk here, haven't you? We all thought this storm had sluiced her. Made
      quite a stir up and down the water-front when old Can-dage blew along and
      reported that she had lived it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon some of the panic boys are talking in another key about the
      prospects out here, about now, aren't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't so sure about that, sir,&rdquo; stated the towboat man, loafing into an
      easier attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't there a feeling on shore that we are likely to make good on this
      proposition?&rdquo; There was solicitude in Mayo's voice. He was acutely
      anxious. On the sentiment ashore depended Captain Candage's success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't say that I hear of any!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the talk must&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain't very much talk&mdash;not now. It's generally reckoned that
      this packet is a gone goose and folks are talking about something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she is here&mdash;she is upright and fast! She is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The towboat man was not enough interested to listen to statements
      concerning the <i>Conomo's</i> condition. &ldquo;Look-a-here, son,&rdquo; he broke in,
      &ldquo;do you think for a minute that this thing wouldn't have been grabbed up
      by the real people if there had been any show of a make? I know there
      isn't a show!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; demanded Mayo, with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't I been talking with the representative of one of the biggest
      salvaging companies on the Atlantic coast? He's there in Limeport now&mdash;was
      aboard my tug this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does he know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he does know. That's his business. And everybody in Limeport knows
      what he has said. He hasn't been bashful about expressing his opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo leaned over the rail, a baleful light in his eyes indicating what his
      own opinions regarding this unknown detractor were, just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to know who this Lord Guess-so is&mdash;barking behind honest
      men's backs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fogg! That's him! Seems to know his business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fogg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Exactly!' That's his great word,&rdquo; explained the other, grinning. &ldquo;Some
      chap, too, with cigars and language!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the gods, now I know who chartered this tug!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;What kind
      of a fool am I getting to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and ran toward the officers' quarters. He leaped into the main
      passageway and explored headlong the staterooms. There was no sign of his
      visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, in the tumult of his thoughts, he had only a glimmering of
      an idea as to what might be the motive of the man's visit. But he was
      certain, now, that a wretch who had deliberately wrecked a rival steamer&mdash;if
      Candage's suspicions were correct&mdash;would do almost anything else for
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      A narrow companionway with brass rails led below to the crew's quarters.
      Mayo, coming to the head of it, saw the man hurrying to its foot. The
      captain grasped the rails and slid down with one swoop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the devil's name are you doing?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intruder grabbed him and threw him to one side, and started up the
      companionway. He had dropped the suit-case to seize Mayo, and it bounced
      in a way to show that it was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo leaped and grasped the other's legs as he was mounting. The man
      kicked him ferociously in the breast before the attacker managed to pinion
      the legs in his arms. They went down together, rolling over and over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger was stocky and strong, his muscles toughened by a sailor's
      activities. Moreover, he seemed to be animated by something more than a
      mere grudge or desire to defend himself; he fought with frenzy, beating
      his fists into Mayo's face and sides as they rolled. Then he began to
      shout. He fairly screamed, struggling to release himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his assailant was just as tough and just as desperate, and he had a
      younger man's superior agility. The other had forced the fight. Mayo
      proposed to hang to him until he discovered the meaning of this peculiar
      ferocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flipped across his prisoner, clutched him by both ears, and rapped the
      man's head so smartly on the deck planks that his victim relaxed, half
      unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he opened staring eyes. &ldquo;Let me go! Let me go! I quit. Run for it.
      Let me run. We're goners!&rdquo; he squalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run? Why?&rdquo; demanded the victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dynamite! I've planted it. The fuse is going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Below&mdash;somewhere. I've forgot. I, can't remember. My mind is gone.
      I'm too scared to think. Run!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo jumped up and yanked the man to his feet. &ldquo;Take me to it!&rdquo; he
      shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain't time. I guessed at the fuse&mdash;it may burn quicker than I
      reckoned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man drove his fist into the other's face and knocked him down.
      Then he jerked him upright again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me where you've planted that dynamite or we'll stay here and go up
      together. And now you know I mean what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last blow had cowed his man; he raised his fist again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor leaped away from him and ran along the lower deck, Mayo at his
      heels. He led the way aft. In the gloom of betweendecks there gleamed a
      red spark. Mayo rushed to it, whipped off his cap, and snuffed the baleful
      glow. When he was sure that the fuse was dead he heard his man scrambling
      up the companion ladder. He pursued and caught the quarry as he gained the
      upper deck, and buffeted the man about the ears and forced him into a
      stateroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This means state prison for you! You were guilty of barratry before, and
      you know it! How did you dare to try this last trick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had my orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orders from what man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter. You needn't ask. I won't tell.&rdquo; The stranger was sullen, and
      had recovered some of his assurance, now that his fear of the dynamite was
      removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a lunatic. You ought to have known you couldn't pull off a thing
      of this kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know about that! It was working pretty slick. If she had split
      and gone off these ledges, you couldn't have proved anything special. I've
      got good backing. You better let me go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo glared at him, deprived of speech by this effrontrery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better come over with the big fellows,&rdquo; advised the man. &ldquo;I can
      tell you right now that every hole in Limeport has been plugged against
      you. You can't hire equipment there, or get a cent's credit. It has all
      been nicely attended to. You're here fooling with a dead duck. You'd be
      better off if that dynamite had been let alone to split her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The entire uselessness of words in a situation like this, the inadequacy
      of speech to meet such brazen boldness, checked Mayo's oath-peppered
      anathema. He pulled the key from the stateroom door and menaced the
      prisoner with his fist when the man started to follow him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't dare to keep me aboard here! Take warning by what they have
      already done to you, Mayo! I'm sure of my backing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have a chance to use it!&rdquo; retorted the young man. He dodged out
      and locked the stateroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your passenger is not going back with you, sir,&rdquo; he called down over the
      rail to the towboat captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take my orders from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are taking them from me now. Cast off!&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean what I say, sir. That man you brought out here is going to stay
      till I can put him into the hands of the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has he done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The less you know about the matter the better it will be for yourself and
      your boat! You tell the man who chartered your tug&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have him aboard, there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo looked straight into the towboat man's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell Mr. Fogg, who chartered your tug, that I have his man under lock
      and key and that the more riot he starts over the matter the better I will
      be satisfied. And don't bring any more passengers out here unless they are
      police officers.&rdquo; Then he roared in his master-mariner tones: &ldquo;Cast off
      your lines, sir. You know what the admiralty law is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain nodded, closed his pilot-house window, and clanged his bell.
      Mayo knew by his mystified air that he was not wholly in the confidence of
      his passenger and his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bungling, barefaced attempt to destroy the steamer touched Mayo's
      pride as deeply as it stirred his wrath. Fogg evidently viewed the
      pretensions of the new ownership with contempt. He must have belief in his
      own power to ruin and to escape consequences, pondered the young man. He
      had put Mayo and his humble associates on the plane of the ordinary
      piratical wreckers of the coast-men who grabbed without law or right, who
      must be prepared to fight other pirates of the same ilk, and whose affairs
      could have no standing in a court of law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even more disquieting were the statements that the avenues of credit
      ashore had been closed. Malicious assertions could ruin the project more
      effectually than could dynamite. But now that the <i>Conomo</i> had
      withstood the battering of a gale and bulked large on the reef, a visible
      pledge of value, it did seem that Captain Candage must be able to find
      somebody who would back them.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two days Mayo waited with much impatience, he and his men doing such
      preliminary work as offered itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He expected that Fogg would send a relief expedition, but his
      apprehensions bore no fruit. His prisoner was sourly reticent and by the
      few words he did drop seemed to console himself with the certainty that
      retribution awaited Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third day came the schooner. She came listlessly, under a light
      wind, and her limp sails seemed to express discouragement and
      disappointment. Mayo, gazing across to her as she approached, received
      that impression, in spite of his hopes. He got a glimpse of Captain
      Candage's face as he came to the steamer's side in his dory, and his fears
      were confirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tain't no use,&rdquo; was the skipper's laconic report as he swung up the
      ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say you didn't get a rise out of anybody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing doing nowhere. There's a fat man named Fogg in Limeport, and he
      is spreading talk that we 'ain't got law or prospects. Got a few men to
      listen to me, but they shooed me off when they found that we wouldn't take
      'em in and give 'em all the profits. Went to Maquoit and tried to get
      Deacon Rowley into the thing&mdash;and when I go and beg favors of Deacon
      Rowley, you can imagine how desperate I am. He's a cash-down fellow&mdash;you
      have found that out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But couldn't you show him that this is the best gamble on the coast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain't a gambler; he's a sure-thing operator. And when he knew that we
      had put in all our cash, he threatened to take the schooner away from us
      unless we go back to fishing and 'be sensible'&mdash;that's the way he put
      it. So then him and me had that postponed row.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But look at her,&rdquo; pleaded Mayo, waving his hand, &ldquo;Ice off her, sound in
      all her rivets after her beating. If we could get the right men out here
      now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't confident, myself, no more,&rdquo; stated Captain Candage, running an
      eye of disfavor over their property. &ldquo;If ye get out here away from
      level-headed business men and dream about what might happen, you can fool
      yourself. I can see how it is with you. But I've been ashore, and I've got
      it put to me good and plenty. I did think of one way of getting some
      money, but I come to my senses and give it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Getting money&mdash;how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter. I'd cut off both hands before I'd let them hands take that
      money for a desp'rit thing like this. Let's sell her for scrap to the
      first man who'll take her&mdash;and then mind our own business and go
      fishing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take your turn aboard here and let me go ashore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain't no sense in us wasting more time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've done my trick here, Captain Candage, and it has been a good one. I
      only ask you to take your trick, as a shipmate should. Keep a dozen of the
      men here with you. There's plenty of grub. Stand off all comers till I get
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make a man's try, sir, before I let 'em dump us. We can always go
      fishing. But there's only one<i> Conomo</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll stay. It's only fair to you to have your chance ashore. And I've got
      an almighty good rifle aboard that schooner,&rdquo; stated the skipper. &ldquo;Send it
      to me by one of the men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may need it,&rdquo; stated Captain Mayo, with grim set to his jaw. &ldquo;You
      come with me. I want to show you a bird that flew aboard here the other
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside the stateroom door he halted Captain Candage, who was following on
      his heels, taking Mayo's statement literally, and showing only mild
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Candage, your man, Art Simpson, is in this stateroom. He came out
      here on a tug with a bag of dynamite, and intended to blow up this wreck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gawd-a-mighty, ain't they going to stop at anything?&rdquo; croaked the old
      skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's about time for us to find out how much of this is reckless
      devilishness on the part of hired men and how much the big men really know
      of what is being done on this coast, sir. And that's why I'm holding this
      man Simpson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me at him!&rdquo; pleaded Candage. &ldquo;I'll crack his shell for him! I'll get
      at his meat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo unlocked the door and walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simpson, you&mdash;&rdquo; bawled the old skipper, and then halted in
      confusion, his mouth wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This ain't Art Simpson!&rdquo; he declared, after amazed survey of the
      glowering stranger. &ldquo;Who be ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of your infernal business! When you do know who I am you'll discover
      that you have a tough proposition on your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We realize that already, without knowing your name,&rdquo; retorted Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not worrying; it's for you to do the worrying! I have given you your
      warning! Now take what's coming to you from the men who are behind me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's your name&mdash;that's what I've asked you?&rdquo; demanded Candage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of your business&mdash;that's what I have told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll get some light on that subject after I have you on shore,&rdquo; said
      Mayo. &ldquo;Come on! You're going!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sooner the better!&rdquo; agreed the stranger. &ldquo;I'll relish seeing you get
      yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo wasted no time. He sent his prisoner down the ladder to the dory
      ahead of him, and put out his hand to the old skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can't do better I'll take that devil, whoever he is, by the heels,
      and bat out the brains of the other pirates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon that they'll back down when they, see that you've caught him
      foul,&rdquo; stated the skipper, consolingly. &ldquo;I've got a lot of confidence in
      your grit, sir. But I must say it's a terrible tricky gang we're up
      against, so it seems to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This may be just the right string for us to pull,&rdquo; returned Mayo;
      &ldquo;there's no pleading with them, but we may be able to scare 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I'm too much inclined to look on the dark side,&rdquo; confessed
      Captain Candage. &ldquo;You're going to find 'em all agin' ye ashore, sir. But
      the last words my Polly tells me to say to you was to keep up your courage
      and not to mind my growling. She thinks We have got a sure thing here&mdash;and
      that shows how little a girl knows about men's work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And yet, that one little message of good cheer from the main so comforted
      Mayo that he went on his way with the whimsical thought that girls who
      knew just the right time to give a pat and bestow a smile did understand
      man's work mighty well.

     Day out and in the blackfish there
        Go wabbling out and under,
     And nights we watch the coasters creep
        From light to light in yonder.
                     &mdash;The Skipper.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was the period of January calms&mdash;that lull between the tempest
      ravings of the equinoxes, and the <i>Ethel and May</i> made slow time of
      it on her return to the main. In Mayo's mood of anxious impatience, hope
      in his affairs was as baffling as the winds in the little schooner's
      sails.
    </p>
    <p>
      His passenger sat on the rail and gave the pacing captain occasional
      glances in which irony and sullenness were mingled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you're going to put me into court, eh?&rdquo; he inquired, when at last they
      drifted past the end of the breakwater at Limeport. &ldquo;Well, that will give
      you a good excuse for throwing up your work on that wreck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo kept on walking and did not reply. He had been pondering on the
      question of what to do with this new &ldquo;elephant&rdquo; on his hands. In a way,
      this stranger was an unwieldy proposition to handle in conjunction with
      the problem of the <i>Conomo</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just understand that I don't give a hoot in a scuttlebutt if you do turn
      me over to the police,&rdquo; pursued the man. &ldquo;I'm going to be taken care of.
      So will you! You'll be tied up! Courts like to have chief witnesses attend
      strictly to the job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man had only a sailor's vague knowledge of the procedure of
      courts of law; but that knowledge and considerable hearsay had convinced
      him that law was lagging, exacting, and overbearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      All his time, his best efforts, his presence were needed in the gigantic
      task he had undertaken at Razee. To allow himself to be mired in a law
      scrape together with this person, even in criminal prosecution of the man,
      surely meant delay, along with repeated interruption of his work, if not
      its abandonment for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's your boss?&rdquo; he demanded, stopping in front of the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't try to bluff me. Fogg, I mean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll probably find Mr. Fogg at the Nicholas Hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to walk you up there. If you try to run away&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run your Aunt Huldah! Piff, son! Now you're showing sense. Take me to Mr.
      Fogg. You'll be shown a few things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had no difficulty in finding Mr. Fogg. He was in front of the fire in
      the office of the Nicholas, toasting his back and warming his slowly
      fanning palms, and talking to a group of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      He affected non-recognition of Mayo when the young man asked, brusquely,
      if he might see him in private.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir. And your friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger, following up the stairs with Mayo, nudged his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a wonder! 'And your friend?'&rdquo; he quoted with a chuckle. &ldquo;No coarse
      work about that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo had firmly decided in his mind that his present business was the only
      matter he would discuss with Fletcher Fogg. Even though the just wrath of
      an innocent man, ruined and persecuted, prompted him to assail this smug
      trickster with tongue, and even with fists, he bound himself by mental
      promise to wait until he had proofs other than vague words and his own
      convictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo; invited Fogg, when he had closed the door of his room,
      waiting tmtil his callers had entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, <i>now!</i>&rdquo; blurted Captain Mayo. &ldquo;Not <i>then</i>, Mr. Fogg! We'll
      have that settled later, when I make you pay for what you did to me. This
      man here, you know him, of course! He tried to dynamite the <i>Conomo</i>.
      I caught him in the act. He is your man. He has made his boasts that he
      would be protected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg turned a cold stare upon the man's appreciative grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw this person before, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know better!&rdquo; Mayo leaped to a conclusion, and bluffed. &ldquo;I can prove by
      men here in this city that you have been talking with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may have been one of the persons who came to me asking for work on the
      wreck, providing my concern decided to salvage. But we concluded not to
      undertake the work, and I paid no attention to him. As far as any memory
      of mine is concerned, I never saw him before, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't represent any salvage company,&rdquo; insisted Mayo. &ldquo;You have come
      here to interfere with anybody who tries to salvage that steamer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your business with me, sir? Get somewhere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to show you this man. If you'll keep your hands off my
      affairs, shut your mouth, and stop telling men here that the plan to
      salvage is hopeless, I'll turn this man over to you. You know what I ought
      to do to you right here and now, Fogg,&rdquo; he cried, savagely. &ldquo;But I'm not
      going to bother&mdash;not now. I'm here to trade with you on this one
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall take this man to the police station and lodge my complaint.
      When criminal prosecution starts you'll see what happens to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go as far as you like,&rdquo; consented Mr. Fogg, listlessly. &ldquo;You can't make
      me responsible for the acts of a person I don't know from Adam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your last word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is!&rdquo; snapped the promoter. &ldquo;You must be a lunatic to think
      anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. May I use your telephone to call the police?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; Mr. Fogg lighted a cigar and picked up a newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment before you use that 'phone,&rdquo; objected the third member of
      the party. &ldquo;I want an understanding. You please step out of the room,
      Mayo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay where you are,&rdquo; commanded Fogg. &ldquo;I'll give no chance for any
      underhand work.&rdquo; He scowled when the prisoner winked at him. &ldquo;This looks
      to me like a put-up job between you two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing put up between us,&rdquo; declared the man. &ldquo;There'd better be
      something put up between <i>you</i> two. The thing can go about so far,
      where I'm concerned, and no farther. I want an understanding, I say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fogg slapped open the pages of his newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made my talk,&rdquo; said Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gad, I'm not going to jail&mdash;not for anybody!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fogg removed his eye-glasses and gave the man a full, unblinking stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you try to dynamite that wreck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that orders&mdash;orders to talk right out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orders? I don't know what you mean, sir. I have asked you a plain
      question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you want an answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I tried to do didn't work&mdash;he was too quick for me. There, now,
      get together! He has made you a fair offer, Mr. Fogg. There's no need of
      my going to jail. I won't go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to go, for what you did!&rdquo; commented Fogg, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, for what he didn't do&mdash;from your standpoint,&rdquo; suggested Captain
      Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have been boasting, eh?&rdquo; Fogg kept up his disconcerting stare,
      with fishy eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't going to let men walk over me and wipe their feet on me when I'm
      obeying orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orders from whom, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Condemn it all, orders from men who can protect me by saying one word! I
      ain't going to stand all this riddle-come-ree business! Flat down, now,
      Mr. Fogg, what say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word! If what this fellow says is true, you ought to be in jail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The advice is good. He'll be there very soon,&rdquo; declared Mayo, starting
      for the telephone. Fogg replaced his eye-glasses and began to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm ready to blow up!&rdquo; warned the man. He hurried across the room and
      guarded the telephone with outspread arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both of you will be sorry if the police are called,&rdquo; he cried. To Mayo,
      who was close to him, he mumbled, &ldquo;Damn him, if he dumps me like this
      you're going to be the winner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was so much reality in the man's rancor that Mayo was impressed and
      seized upon the idea which came to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll test your friend,&rdquo; he whispered, clutching the man, and making
      pretense of a struggle. &ldquo;I'll fake a call. Keep wrestling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fogg gave only indifferent attention to the affair in the corner of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one hand holding down the receiver-arm Mayo called; he was pushed
      about violently, but managed to say: &ldquo;Desk? Call police to hotel&mdash;lobby&mdash;at
      once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fogg,&rdquo; pleaded the man, giving Mayo an understanding nudge with his
      elbow, &ldquo;ain't you going to give me a chance for a private talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you ever speak to me or try to see me again I'll have you arrested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're dumping me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out of this room, both of you! I don't want the police up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo clapped hand on his prisoner's shoulder and pushed him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go down-stairs slow,&rdquo; protested the man. &ldquo;He is bound to come out and
      call me back! He's got to! He doesn't dare to dump me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He dares to do anything,&rdquo; stated Mayo, bitterly, &ldquo;including what he did
      to me and the <i>Montana</i>. I suppose you read about it&mdash;everybody
      else did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked leisurely, but Mr. Fogg's door remained closed. They waited in
      the office of the hotel. He did not appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Judas!&rdquo; rasped the man, &ldquo;another two-spot torn up and thrown into the
      discard along with you! And I helped 'em do it to you! I'm coming across,
      Mayo! That telephone business was a mighty friendly trick to help me force
      him. I appreciate it! I was on board the <i>Montana</i> that night you and
      she got yours! My name is Burkett&mdash;Oliver. I was there, though you
      didn't see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you were there, afterward,&rdquo; stated Captain Mayo, grimly. &ldquo;Captain
      Wass mentioned you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And probably didn't give me much of a reputation. I can't help that! You
      needn't put one bit more trust in me, Captain Mayo, than you want to. I
      don't ask you to have any respect for me. But I want to tell you that when
      a man promises to back me and then turns round and dumps me so as to cover
      his own tracks, he will get his if I'm able to hand it to him! I'm
      generally dirty. I'm especially dirty in a case like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you show me any favors, Mr. Burkett, I suppose I'll have to depend on
      your spite against Fogg instead of your affection for me. You see, I'm
      perfectly frank. But I have been fooled too much to place any trust in
      anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't ask you to trust me. I know how the <i>Montana</i> job was done.
      I'm not going to tell you right now. I'm going to make sure that I have
      been thrown down by Fogg. And if I have been&mdash;if he means it&mdash;I'm
      going to use you so that I can get back at him, no matter how much it
      helps you. I can be pretty frank myself, you understand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were silent and looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; inquired Burkett, sourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo; asked Mayo, with as little show of liking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about this police business&mdash;about your complaint against me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to say anything about the case! You're free, as far as I'm
      concerned. I am ashore here to make a raise of money or credit. I can't
      spend any time in court, bothering with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you got your satisfaction out of that beating-up you gave me. I
      rather began to like you after that,&rdquo; said Burkett, pulling one corner of
      his mouth into a grin that was a grimace. &ldquo;I'm going to stay at this
      hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fogg will see that our affair just now was a bluff. He will have you into
      camp once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got to take your chances on it, Mayo. What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take my chances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gad! sir, you're a square chap, and I'm not meeting many of that sort
      in these days! Let this thing hang. Before you leave the city, slip word
      to me here. I'll tell you the news!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that understanding they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later, acknowledging to himself that he was a thoroughly beaten
      young man, Mayo walked into the Nicholas Hotel. He had been unable to
      secure either encouragement, money, or credit. There were parties who
      would back him in any attempt to junk the <i>Conomo</i>; but his
      proposition to raise her with the aid of the tribe of Hue and Cry made his
      project look like a huge joke and stirred hearty amusement all along the
      water-front. Everywhere he found proof of Fogg's neat work of
      discouragement. If a real salvaging company had turned the scheme down as
      impracticable, how could penniless amateurs hope? It was conceded in
      business and financial circles that they hoped because they were amateurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo's outlook on his own strictly personal affairs was as dismal as his
      view of the Razee project in which his associates were concerned. He went
      to the hotel merely because he had promised Burkett that he would notify
      that modern buccaneer regarding any intended departure. He despondently
      reflected that if Fogg and Burkett had agreed again, the combination
      against him still existed. If they were persistently on the outs, Burkett
      was merely a discredited agent whose word, without proofs, could be as
      easily brushed away as his connection with Fogg in the' matter of the <i>Conomo</i>.
      In fact, so Mayo pondered, he might find association with Burkett
      dangerous, because demands for consideration can be twisted into semblance
      of blackmail by able lawyers. He entertained so few hopes in regard to any
      assistance from Burkett that he was rather relieved to discover that the
      man was no longer a guest at the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he left town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose there's no secret about the thing,&rdquo; explained the clerk. &ldquo;Mr.
      Fogg had the man arrested yesterday, for threatening words and actions.
      Something of that sort. Anyway, he is in jail and must give bonds to keep
      the peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo's flagging interest in the possibilities of Burkett as an aid in his
      affairs was a bit quickened by that piece of news, and he hurried up to
      the jail. If ever a captured and fractious bird of passage was beating
      wings against his cage's bars in fury and despair, Mr. Burkett was doing
      it with vigor. Mayo, admitted as a friend who might aid in quelling the
      disturbance that was making the deafened jailers and noise-maddened
      prisoners regret the presence of Mr. Burkett, found the man clinging to
      the iron rods and kicking his foot against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the last thing he did before he left town, this what he has done to
      me. I can't give bonds. I don't know anybody in this city,&rdquo; raved the
      prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid that I don't know the folks here very well, judging from my
      experiences trying to raise money,&rdquo; stated Captain Mayo, after he had
      quieted Burkett. &ldquo;But I'll go out and see what I can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After some pleading he induced a fish wholesaler to go to the jail with
      him and inspect Burkett as a risk in the matter of bonds. Mr. Burkett,
      being a man of guile, controlled his wrath and offered a presentable guise
      of mildness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how am I going to know that he won't be hunting this enemy up as soon
      as I give bonds?&rdquo; asked the fishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Mayo is tackling a job of wrecking, offcoast,&rdquo; said Burkett, &ldquo;and
      I'm out of work just now and will go with him. I'll be a safe risk, all
      right, out there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that go with you, Captain Mayo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the matter of bonds had been arranged before the commissioner, and
      when Burkett walked down the street with Mayo, the latter stopped on a
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have to leave you here, Burkett. I'm going aboard the schooner.
      We're sailing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how about your taking me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was willing to help you lie that much, Burkett. I knew you did not
      intend to go with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to put you in bad with anybody after this, Captain Mayo. I
      need to keep away for a time where I won't be in danger of seeing Fletcher
      Fogg. If I meet him while I'm frothing like this, I'll kill him, even if
      it means the chair. Give me a lay aboard that steamer, no matter how bad
      your prospects are, and I'll be square with you. That's my man's word to
      you. I realize it isn't much of a word in your estimation&mdash;but there
      are some promises I can keep. I propose to help you get back at Fogg and
      his gang. That's reason enough for what I'm doing,&rdquo; he pleaded, earnestly.
      &ldquo;You ought to see that yourself. I'm just as good a man with machinery as
      I am in the pilot-house. I won't set you back any!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mr. Burkett, come along,&rdquo; agreed Mayo, curtly, without
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a fair wind for their departure and Mayo headed the schooner for
      Maquoit. The few words which Captain Candage had dropped in regard to
      Rowley's state of mind worried Mayo. His little edifice of hope was
      tottering to a fall, but the loss of the <i>Ethel and May</i> meant the
      last push and utter ruin. He decided that he was in honor bound to
      preserve the schooner for the uses of the men of Hue and Cry, even if it
      meant abandonment of the <i>Conomo</i> and going back to fishing. Without
      that craft they would be paupers once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Ethel and May</i> sneaked her way into Maquoit harbor&mdash;if a
      schooner can be said to sneak. A breeze at nightfall fanned her along, and
      when her killick went down, the rusty chain groaned querulously from her
      hawse-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo rowed ashore and toiled his way up the little street to the widow's
      cottage. He was ashamed to meet Polly Candage&mdash;ashamed with the
      feelings of a strong man who has put out every effort and has failed. But,
      somehow, he wanted to feel that sisterly grip of her hand and look down
      into those encouraging gray eyes. He remembered that in times past she had
      soothed and stimulated him. This time he did not come to her expecting to
      get new courage for further effort; he had exhausted all resources, he
      told himself. But in his bitter humiliation he needed the companionship of
      a true friend&mdash;yes, he felt, almost, that she was now the only friend
      he had left. His experiences with those whom he had before looked on as
      friends had made him feel that he stood alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came running to him in the little parlor, her hands outstretched and
      her face alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt at first sight of her, and his face flushed at thought of his
      weakness, that he wanted to put his head on her shoulder and weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor boy, things have not been going well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He choked, for the caress in her tones touched his heart. He patted her
      hands, and she sat down beside him on the old haircloth sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had a terrible week of it, Polly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her sweet smile did not waver. The gray eyes stared straight into his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have talked to 'em till my mouth has been parched and my tongue sore,
      and God knows my heart is sore. All they do is look at me and shake their
      heads. I thought I had friends alongshore&mdash;men who believed in me&mdash;men
      who would take my word and help me. I'll never be fooled again by the
      fellows who pat you on the back in sunny weather, and won't lend you an
      umbrella when it rains unless you'll leave your watch with 'em for
      security. And speaking of the watch,&rdquo; he went on, smiling wistfully, for
      her mere presence and her unspoken sympathy had begun to cheer him,
      &ldquo;reminds me why I'm here in Maquoit. Oh yes,&rdquo; he put in, hastily, catching
      a queer look of disappointment on her face, &ldquo;I did want to see you. I
      looked forward to seeing you after all the others had turned their backs
      on me. There's something wonderfully comforting in your face, Polly, when
      you just look at me. You don't have to say a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do thank you, Boyd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear that Rowley is getting uneasy about his schooner&mdash;wants to
      take it away from us. So I have sold my watch and all the other bits of
      personal things I could turn into cash, and am here to give him the money
      and tell him we're going back to fishing again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll give up the steamer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and hopes and prospects and all. I've got to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you could win!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll stay down where I belong. I won't dream any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't give up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing else to do. We poor devils need something besides our
      bare hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl struggled mightily with her next question, but he did not note
      her emotions, for his elbows were on his knees and he was staring at the
      rag carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it cost a lot of money for what you want to do on the steamer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may need a lot before we can do it all. But I have been sitting up
      nights planning the thing, Polly. I have gone over and over it. When I was
      on board the steamer waiting for your father, I examined her as best I
      could.. If I had a little money, I could make a start, and after I
      started, and could show the doubters what could be done, I could raise
      more money then. I am sure of it. Of course the first investment is the
      most dangerous gamble, and that's why everybody is shy. But I believe my
      scheme would work, though I can't seem to get anybody else to believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will I understand if you'll tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd get a diver's outfit and material, and build bulk-heads in her, both
      sides of the hole in her bottom. Then I'd have an engine and pumps, and
      show that I could get the water out of her, or enough of it so that she'd
      float.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the big hole, you wouldn't mend that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we could brace the bulkheads so that we could hold the water out
      of both ends of her and let the main hole in her alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she wouldn't sink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was patient with the girl's unwisdom in the ways of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you've been here at Maquoit, Polly, you have seen the
      lobster-smacks with what they call 'wells' in them. All amidships is full
      of water, you know&mdash;comes in through holes bored in the hull&mdash;fresh
      sea-water that swashes in and out and keeps the lobsters alive till they
      get to market. But the vessel is tight at both ends, and she floats. Well,
      that's what I plan to do with the Conomo. With a few thousand dollars I'm
      sure I can make enough of a start so I can show 'em the rest can be done.&rdquo;
       He promptly lost the bit of enthusiasm he had shown while he was
      explaining. He began his gloomy survey of the carpet once more. &ldquo;But it's
      no use. Nobody will listen to a man who wants to borrow money on a wild
      hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent a long time, and gazed at him, and he did not realize that
      he was the object of such intent regard. Several times she opened her
      mouth and seemed about to address him eagerly, for her eyes were brilliant
      and her cheeks were flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had the money to lend you,&rdquo; she ventured, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wouldn't take it&mdash;not from a girl, Polly. No, indeed! This is
      a gamble for men&mdash;not an investment for the widow and orphan,&rdquo; he
      declared, smiling at her. &ldquo;I believe in it; that's because I'm desperate
      and need to win. It's for a big reason, Polly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face away and grew pale. She flushed at his next words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The biggest thing in the world to me is getting that steamer off Razee
      and showing that infernal Marston and all his 'longcoast gang that I'm no
      four-flusher. I've got it in for 'em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He patted the hands she clasped on her knees, and he did not notice that
      she was locking her fingers so tightly that they were almost bloodless. He
      rose and started for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go and pacify Rowley to-night, and be ready for an early start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boyd,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;will you do me a little favor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly, Polly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till to-morrow morning for your business with Mr. Rowley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; He looked at her with considerable surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;well, because you are a bit unstrung, and are tired, and
      you and he might have words, and you might not use your cool judgment if
      he should be short with you. You know you are a little at odds with all
      the world just now!&rdquo; She spoke nervously and smiled wistfully. &ldquo;I would be
      sorry to have you quarrel with Mr. Rowley because&mdash;well, father is a
      partner, and has already had words with him. Please wait till morning. You
      must not lose the schooner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm too far down and out to dare to quarrel with Rowley, but I'll do as
      you say, Polly. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a good boy to obey a girl's whim. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment his foot was off the last step of the porch she hurried to her
      room in the cottage and secured a little packet from her portfolio.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard the thud of his dory oars as she walked down the street. She was
      glad to know that he was safely out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowley's dingy windows shed a dim blur upon the frosty night. It was near
      time for him to close his store, and when she entered he was turning out
      the loafers who had been cuddling close to his barrel stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few moments of waiting the girl was alone with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't want to buy anything, Mr. Rowley. I need your help. I ask you
      to help me to do a good deed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled his spectacles to the end of his nose and stared at her
      doubtfully and with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it's about the schooner, I'd rather do business with men-folks,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is business that only you and I can do, and it must be a secret
      between us. Will you please glance at this bank-book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He licked a thin finger and turned the leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deposit of five thousand dollars and accrued interest,&rdquo; he observed,
      resuming his inquisitive inspection of her animated countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother's sister left me that legacy. It's all my little fortune, sir.
      I want to loan that money to my father and Captain Mayo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go ahead, if you're fool enough to. I ain't your guardeen,&rdquo;
       assented Deacon Rowley, holding the book out to her. &ldquo;But I advise you to
      keep your money. I know all about their foolishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father wouldn't take it from me&mdash;and Captain Mayo wouldn't,
      either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That shows they ain't rogues on top of being fools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have faith that they can succeed and make a lot of money if they
      get a start,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;I see you do not understand, sir, what I need
      of you. I want you to lend them that money, just as if it came from you.
      I'll give you the book and a writing, and you can draw it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you help a girl who needs help so much? You're a Christian man, you
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just why I can't lie about this money. I'll have to tell 'em I'm
      lending it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be lending it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's that, miss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your trouble in the matter I'll let you collect the interest for
      yourself at six per cent. Oh, Deacon Rowley, all you need to do is hand
      over the money, and say you prefer not to talk about it. You're a smart
      business man; you'll know what to say without speaking a falsehood. You'll
      break my heart if you refuse. Think! You're only helping me to help my own
      father. He has foolish notions about this. You can say you'll let them
      have it for a year, and you'll get three hundred dollars interest for your
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe they'll ever make enough to pay the interest&mdash;much
      less the principal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give them five thousand dollars and draw a year's interest for yourself
      out of my interest that has accrued.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, how old be you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be twenty-two in June.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Deacon Rowley looked at her calculatingly, fingering his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being of age, you ought to know better, but being of age, you can do what
      you want to with your own. Do you promise never to let on to anybody about
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do promise, solemnly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you sign some papers when I get 'em drawn up, and I'll hand 'em the
      money; but look-a-here, if I go chasing 'em with five thousand dollars,
      I'll have 'em suspecting that I'm crazy, or something worse. It ain't like
      Rufus Rowley to do a thing of this sort with his money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; she confessed, softening her frank agreement with an
      ingenuous smile. &ldquo;But Captain Mayo is coming to you to-morrow morning on
      business about the schooner, and you can put the matter to him in some
      way. Oh, I know you're so keen and smart you can do it without his
      suspecting a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know whether you're complimenting me or sassing me, miss. But
      I'll see it through, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She signed the papers giving him power of attorney, left her bank-book
      with him, and went away into the night, her face radiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw a happy kiss at the dim anchor light which marked the location
      of the <i>Ethel and May</i> in the harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am helping you get the girl you love,&rdquo; she said, aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went on toward the widow's cottage. Her head was erect, but there were
      tears on her cheeks.

      XXIX ~ THE TOILERS OF OLD RAZEE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Hurrah! Hurrah! for Yankee wit.
     Hurrah! Hurrah! for Cape Ann grit.
     It's pluck and dash that's sure to win&mdash;&ldquo;The <i>Horton's</i> in!
     The <i>Horton's</i> in!&rdquo;
                   &mdash;Old Locality.
</pre>
    <p>
      Polly Candage, covering her emotions with that mask of demureness which
      nature lends to the weaker sex for their protection, received a tumultuous
      Mayo next morning in the parlor of the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how it has happened. I don't understand it,&rdquo; he exploded. &ldquo;I
      didn't suppose anybody could blast money out of his pocket with dynamite&mdash;your
      father said it couldn't be done. But Deacon Rowley has loaned us five
      thousand dollars. Here's his check on the Limeport First National. Only
      charges six per cent. I'm so weak it was all I could do to walk up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say to explain it?&rdquo; inquired Polly, with maiden's curiosity
      in learning to what extent of prevarication a deacon would go in order to
      make three hundred dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't say much of anything. Handed out this check, said my indorsement
      on it would be enough for a receipt, and said your father and I could sign
      a joint note later&mdash;sometime&mdash;when he got around to it. Have you
      heard any rumor that the old fellow is losing his mind? But this check
      looks good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think he's been pondering on the matter since father was here. In
      fact, Deacon Rowley has said a few things to me,&rdquo; said the girl, meeting
      Mayo's gaze frankly. &ldquo;Not much, of course, but something that hinted he
      had a lot of confidence in both of you, seeing that you have used him
      nicely in the other business he has done with you. Sometimes, you know,
      these hard old Yankees take a liking to somebody and do things all of a
      sudden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is sudden, all right enough,&rdquo; stated Mayo, scratching the serrated
      edge of the check across his palm as if to make sure it was real and not a
      shadow. &ldquo;Yes, he told me not to mention the note to him till he said
      something to us about it himself, and to keep quiet about the loan. Didn't
      want others running to him with their schemes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I were in your place,&rdquo; advised the girl, &ldquo;I wouldn't tell father
      where you got the money&mdash;not for a time. You know, he doesn't get
      along so very well with Deacon Rowley&mdash;old folks sometimes do quarrel
      so&mdash;and he might be worried, thinking the deacon had some scheme
      behind this. But you don't think that way, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the money, and he hasn't asked me to sign any papers. There's no
      come-back there, far as I can see,&rdquo; declared the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what will you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rush for Limeport, hire equipment&mdash;for I've cash to pay in advance
      for any leases&mdash;and get to that wreck and on to my job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply tell father you raised the money&mdash;from a friend! If he is
      worrying about anything, he doesn't work half as well. I'll ask God to
      help and bless you every hour in the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Polly Candage,&rdquo; cried Mayo, taking her warm, plump hands, &ldquo;there's
      something about you that has put courage and grit and determination in me
      ever since you patted my shoulder there in the old Polly. I have been
      thinking it over a lot&mdash;I had time to think when I was out aboard
      that steamer, waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's only one girl for you to think about,&rdquo; she chided.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face clouded. &ldquo;And it's the kind of thinking that isn't healthy for a
      man with a normal mind. Thank the Lord, I've got some real work to think
      about now&mdash;and the cash to do that work with.&rdquo; He fondled his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went with him to the wharf, and when the schooner slid to sea behind
      Hue and Cry her white handkerchief gave him final salute and silent
      God-speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Boyd Mayo, back in Limeport once more, was not the cowed,
      apologetic, pleading suppliant who had solicited the water-front
      machinists and ship-yard owners a few days before. He proffered no checks
      for them to look askance at. He pulled a wallet that was plethoric with
      new yellowbacks. He showed his money often, and with a purpose. He drove
      sharp bargains while he held it in view. He received offers of credit in
      places where before he had been denied. Such magic does visible wealth
      exert in the dealings between men!
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not come across Fletcher Fogg in Limeport, and he was glad of that.
      Somebody informed him that the magnate had gone back to New York. It was
      manifest to Mayo that in his contempt Fogg had decided that the salvaging
      of the <i>Conomo</i> intact had been relegated to the storehouse of
      dreams. His purpose would be suited if she were junked, so the young man
      realized. Only the <i>Conomo</i> afloat, a successful pioneer in new
      transportation experiments alongcoast, would threaten his vested
      interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been wintry winds and intervening calms in the days since Mayo
      had been prosecuting his projects ashore. But by word of mouth from
      straying fishermen and captains of packets he had been assured that the
      steamer still stuck on Razee.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when at last he was equipped he went forth from Limeport; he went
      blithely, although he knew that a Titan's job faced him. He kept his own
      counsel as to what he proposed to do with the steamer. He even allowed the
      water-front gossips to guess, unchallenged, that he was going to junk the
      wreck. He was not inviting more of that brazen hostility that
      characterized the operations of Fogg and his hirelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at the wheel of a husky lighter which he had chartered; the rest of
      the crew he supplied from his own men. The lighter was driven by its own
      power, and carried a good pump and a sturdy crane; its decks were loaded
      high with coal. The schooner was now merely convoy. It was an all-day trip
      to Razee, for the lighter was a slow and clumsy craft, but when Mayo at
      last made fast to the side of the <i>Conomo</i> and squealed a shrill
      salute with the whistle, the joy he found in Captain Candage's rubicund
      countenance made amends for anxiety and delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you'd make a go of it, somehow,&rdquo; vouchsafed the old skipper. &ldquo;But
      who did you have to knock down in a dark place so as to steal his money
      off'n him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's private business till we get ready to pay it back, with six per
      cent, interest,&rdquo; stated the young man, bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well. So long as we've got it I don't care where you stole it,&rdquo;
       returned Candage, with great serenity. &ldquo;I simply know that you didn't get
      it from skinflint Rowley, and that's comfort enough for me. Let me tell
      you that we haven't been loafing on board here. We rigged that taakul you
      see aloft, and jettisoned all the cargo we could get at. It was all
      spoiled by the water. There's pretty free space for operations 'midships.
      I've got out all her spare cable, and it's ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you've done a good job there, sir. We've got to make this lighter
      fast alongside in such a way that a blow won't wreck her against us.
      Spring cables&mdash;plenty of them&mdash;and we are sailors enough to know
      how to moor. But when I think of what amateurs we are in the rest of this
      job, cold shivers run over me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Limeport water-front crowd got at you, too, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Candage, I have watched men more or less in this life. It's
      sometimes a mighty big handicap for a man to be too wise. While the
      awfully wise man sits back and shakes his head and figures prospects and
      says it can't be done, the fool rushes in, because he doesn't know any
      better, and blunders the job through and wins out. Let's keep on being
      fools, good and plenty, but keep busy just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And on that basis the rank amateurs of Razee proceeded with all the grit
      that was in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men of Hue and Cry had plenty of muscle and little wit. They asked no
      questions, they did not look forward gioomily to doubtful prospects. The
      same philosophy, or lack of it, that had always made life full of merry
      hope when their stomachs were filled, taking no thought of the morrow,
      animated them now. Fate had given Mayo and his associate an ideal crew for
      that parlous job. It was not a question of union hours and stated wages;
      they worked all night just as cheerily as they worked all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      An epic of the sea was lived there on Razee Reef during the weeks that
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The task which was wrought out would make a story in itself, far beyond
      the confines of such a narrative as this must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bitter toil of many days often proved to be a sad mistake, for the men who
      wrought there had more courage in endeavor than good understanding of
      methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after disappointment, hope revived, for further effort avoided the
      mistakes that had been so costly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brunt of the toil, the duty of being pioneer, fell on Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      He donned a diving-suit and descended into the riven bowels of the wreck
      and cleared the way for the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      On deck they built sections of bulkhead, and he went down and groped in
      the murky water, and spiked the braces and set those sections and calked
      the spaces between bulkhead and hull.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were storms that menaced their lighter and drove the little schooner
      to sea in a welter of tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were calms that cheered them with promise of spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The schooner was the errand-boy that brought supplies and coal from the
      main. But the men who went ashore refused to gossip on the water-front,
      and the occasional craft that hove to in the vicinity of Razee were not
      allowed to land inquisitive persons on the wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      After many weeks the bulkheads were set and the pumps were started. There
      were three crews for these pumps, and their clanking never ceased, day or
      night. There was less water in the fore part; her bow was propped high on
      the ledges. The progress here was encouraging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aft, there were disasters. Three times the bulkhead crumpled under the
      tremendous pressure of the sea, as soon as the pumps had relieved the
      opposing pressure within the hull. Mayo, haggard, unkempt, unshorn, thin
      with his vigils, stayed underwater in his diving-dress until he became the
      wreck of a man. But at last they built a transverse section that promised
      to hold. The pumps began to make gains on the water. As the flood within
      was lowered and they could get at the bulkhead more effectively from the
      inside, they kept adding to it and strengthening it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came the need of more material and more equipment, for the
      gigantic job of floating the steamer was still ahead of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo felt that he had proved his theory and was now in a position to
      enlist the capital that would see them through. He could show a hull that
      was sound except for the rent amidships&mdash;a hull from both ends of
      which the trespassing sea was being evicted. With the money that would
      furnish buoying lighters and tugs and the massive equipment for floating
      her, he felt that he would be able to convert that helpless mass of junk
      into a steamer once more&mdash;change scrap-iron into an active value of
      at least one hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he and Captain Candage had arrived at that hopeful and earnest
      belief, following days of tremulous watching of the work the pumps were
      doing, the young man went again to the main on his momentous errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they sailed into Limeport, Mayo was a bit astonished to see green on
      the sloping hills. He had been living in a waking dream of mighty toil on
      Razee; he had almost forgotten that so many weeks had gone past.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he went ashore in his dory from the schooner, the balmy breath of
      spring breathed out to him from budding gardens and the warm breeze fanned
      his roughened cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he had forgotten that spring had come, so had he forgotten about his
      personal appearance. He had rushed ashore from a man's job that was now
      waiting for him to rush back to it. He did not realize that he looked like
      a cave-man&mdash;resembled some shaggy, prehistoric human; his mind was
      too full of his affairs on Razee.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Captain Mayo strode down the main street of Limeport, it troubled him
      not a whit because folks gaped at him and turned to stare after him. He
      had torn himself from his gigantic task for only one purpose, and that
      idea filled his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was ragged, his hands were swollen, purple, cut, and raw from his
      diver's labors, his hair hung upon his collar, and a beard masked his
      face. They who thronged the streets were taking advantage of the first
      warm days to show their spring finery. The contrast of this rude figure
      from the open sea was made all the more striking as he brushed through the
      crowds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there he bolted into offices where there were men he knew and
      whom he hoped to interest. He had no fat wallet to exhibit to them this
      time. He had only his empty, swollen hands and a wild, eager, stammering
      story of what he expected to do. They stared at him, many of them
      stupidly, some of them frankly incredulous, most of them without
      particular interest. He looked like a man who had failed miserably; there
      was nothing about him to suggest success.
    </p>
    <p>
      One man put the matter succinctly: &ldquo;Look here, Mayo, if you came in here,
      looking the way you do, and asked me for a quarter to buy a meal with, I'd
      think it was perfectly natural, and would slip you the quarter. But not
      ten thousand&mdash;you don't look the part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have my clothes got to do with it? I haven't time to think about
      clothes. I can't wear a plug hat in a diving-suit. I've been working. And
      I'm still on the job. The way I look ought to show you that I mean
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they turned him down. In half a dozen offices they listened and shook
      their heads or curtly refused to look into the thing. He had not come
      ashore to beg for assistance as if it were a favor. He had come feeling
      certain that this time he had a valuable thing to offer. His labors had
      racked his body, his nerves were on edge, his temper was short. When they
      refused to help he cursed them and tore out. That they allowed his
      personal appearance to influence their judgment stirred his fury&mdash;it
      was so unjust to his self-sacrificing devotion to his task.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon exhausted his circle of acquaintances, but the rebuffs made him
      angry instead of despondent. Thrusting rudely past pedestrians who were
      polite and sleek, he marched along the street, scowling.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then his eyes fell on a face that gave a fresh stir to all the
      bitterness that was in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw Fletcher Fogg standing outside the Nicholas Hotel. The day was
      bland, the spring sun was warming, but it was evident that Mr. Fogg was
      not basking contentedly; his countenance was fully as gloomy as that of
      Captain Mayo, and he chewed on an unlighted cigar and spat snippets of
      tobacco over the curb while he pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo was not in a mood to reason with his passion. He had just been
      battering his pride and persistence up against men whose manner of refusal
      showed that they remembered what Fletcher Fogg had said regarding the
      prospects of successful floating of the <i>Conomo</i>. There stood the
      ponderous pirate, blocking Mayo's way on the sidewalk, just as he had
      blocked the young man's prospects in life in the <i>Montana</i> affair&mdash;just
      as he had closed avenues of credit. Mayo bumped against him and crowded
      him back across the sidewalk to the hotel's granite wall. He put his two
      raw, swollen hands on Fogg's immaculate waistcoat and shoved salt-stained,
      work-worn, and bearded face close.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then the promoter did not seem to recognize Mayo. He blinked
      apprehensively. He looked about as if he intended to summon help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't seem to have your iron wishbone in your pocket this time,&rdquo;
       growled the assailant. He jabbed his thumbs cruelly into Fogg's ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad! You're&mdash;you're Captain Mayo! I'll be cursed if I knew you till
      you spoke!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I managed to hold myself in the last time you saw me, Fogg. I was
      waiting. Now, damn you, I've got you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was making reference merely to the physical grip in which he held the
      man. But Fogg seemed to find deeper significance in the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, Mayo,&rdquo; he whined. &ldquo;That's why I'm down here. I have been
      wondering about the best way to get to you&mdash;to meet you right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got to me all right, you infernal renegade!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, see here, Mayo, we can't talk this matter here on the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't going to be any talking!&rdquo; The meeting-up had been so
      unexpected and Mayo's ire was so hasty that the young man had not taken
      thought of what he intended to do. His impulse was to beat that fat face
      into pulp. He had long before given up all hope that any appeal to Fogg as
      a man would help. He expected no consideration, no restitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there must be some talk. I'm here to make it. You have me foul! I
      admit it. But listen to reason,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;It isn't going to do you any
      good to rave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to mash your face for you! I'll take the consequences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But after you do that, you still have got to talk turkey with me about
      those papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his fury, Mayo realized from Fogg's demeanor and his words
      that mere fear of a whipping was not producing this humility; there was a
      policeman on the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk so loud,&rdquo; urged Fogg. &ldquo;Come up to my room where we can be
      private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo hesitated, puzzled by his enemy's attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a word from the Old Man himself. He ordered me down here. It's from
      Marston!&rdquo; whispered the promoter. &ldquo;I'm in a devil of a hole all around,
      Mayo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! I'll come. I can beat you up in your room more comfortably!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not afraid of the beating! I wish that was all there was to it,&rdquo;
       muttered Fogg. He led the way into the hotel and Mayo followed, getting a
      new grip on himself, conscious that there was some new crisis in his
      affairs, scenting surrender of some sort in Fogg's astonishing humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you smoke?&rdquo; asked Fogg, obsequiously, when they were in the hotel
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; He refused with venom. He saw himself in one of the long mirrors and
      had not realized until then how unkempt and uncouth he was. He was ill at
      ease when he sat down in a cushioned chair. For weeks he had been
      accustomed to the rude makeshifts of shipboard. In temper and looks he
      felt like a cave-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm in hopes that we can get together on some kind of a friendly basis,&rdquo;
       entreated Fogg, humbly. &ldquo;Simply fighting the thing over again won't get us
      anywhere. I had to do certain things and I did them. You spoke of my iron
      wishbone! Now about that <i>Montana</i> matter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want any rehearsal, Mr. Fogg. What's your business with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's hard to start unless I can feel that you'd listen to some
      explanations and make some allowances. When a man works for Julius Marston
      he has to forget himself and do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have worked for Julius Marston!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not in the finance game, Mayo!&rdquo; There was a tremble in the promoter's
      voice. &ldquo;Men are only shadows to him when it's a matter of big finance. He
      gives his orders to have results produced. He doesn't stop to think about
      the men concerned. It's the figures on his books he looks at! He uses a
      man like he'd use a napkin at table!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you used me! You have had good training!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if the trick was passed on down, it's now being passed on up,&rdquo;
       stated Fogg, despondently. &ldquo;I'm the goat, right now. Can't you view me
      personally in this matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to. I would get up and use these fists on you, sore as they
      are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid it's going to be a tough matter for us to settle,&rdquo; sighed the
      promoter. &ldquo;I thought I had everything tied up in the usual way. Damn it,
      if it wasn't for a woman being mixed into it, the thing would have worked
      out all right!&rdquo; He let his temper loose. &ldquo;You can never reckon on business
      when a woman sticks in her fingers! I don't care if you are in love with
      Marston's daughter, Mayo! She is like a lot of other cursed high-flier
      girls who have always had more time and money than is good for them. She
      is Trouble swishing petticoats! And you must have considerable of a
      mortgage on her, seeing that she has double-crossed her own father in
      order to pull your chestnuts out of the fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having not the least idea what Mr. Fogg was talking about, Mayo was
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a cool one! I must hand it to you!&rdquo; snapped the promoter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better leave the name of Miss Marston out of this business with me,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in blazes can I leave it out, seeing what she has done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Mayo, not knowing what new outbreak had marked the activities of the
      incomprehensible young lady, resumed his grim silence, his own interests
      suggesting that watchful waiting would be his best policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what are you going to say about the papers?&rdquo; demanded Fogg. &ldquo;We may
      as well get down to cases!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to say anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got to say something, Mayo. This is too big a matter to fool with.
      If you are reasonable, you can help me fix it up&mdash;and that will help
      the girl. She's Mar-ston's daughter, all right, and her father understands
      how erratic she is and makes allowances for her freaks. But he can't stand
      for some things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment curiosity was more ardent in Mayo than resentment, though
      Fogg's tone in regard to Alma Marston did provoke the latter emotion. It
      was evident that she had undertaken something in his behalf&mdash;had in
      some manner sacrificed her father's interests and her own peace of mind in
      order to assist the outcast. He wondered why he did not feel more joy when
      he heard that news. He remembered her promise to him when they parted, but
      he had erected no hopes on that promise. It had not consoled him while he
      had been struggling with his problems. He was conscious that his
      sentiments in regard to the whole affair were rather complex, and he did
      not bother to analyze them; he sat tight and stared at Mr. Fogg with
      non-committal blankness of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you the papers with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right. It may be better, providing they are in a safe place.
      Now see here, Mayo! I'm not going to work any bluffs with you. I can't,
      under the circumstances. I don't know where Burkett went and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burkett is with me on the <i>Conomo</i>. I'm not going to work any bluffs
      with you, either, Fogg!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care where he is nor what he has told you. Any allegations from
      regular liars and men who have been fired can be taken care of in court,
      under the blackmail law. But in the case of those papers it's different.
      I'm open and frank with you, Mayo. We have been betrayed from inside the
      fort. Through some leak in the office that girl got hold of those papers.
      I don't know what your sense of honor is in such matters. I'm not here to
      appeal to it. Too much dirt has been done you to have that argument have
      any special effect. I'm open and frank, I say!&rdquo; He spread his hands.
      &ldquo;Probably she didn't half realize what she was doing! But now that you
      have the papers, you realize!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not by a flicker of an eyelid did Mayo betray his total ignorance of what
      Fogg referred to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to ask you, man to man,&rdquo; proceeded the emissary, &ldquo;whether you
      propose to use those papers simply for yourself&mdash;to get back&mdash;well&mdash;you
      know!&rdquo; He waved his hand. &ldquo;Or are you going to slash right and left with
      'em, for general revenge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't decided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a fair question I have asked. So far as you are concerned in
      anything which may be in those papers&mdash;and that's mostly my own
      reports&mdash;you will be squared and more, captain. You can have the <i>Triton</i>
      with a ten-years' contract as master, contract to be protected by a bond,
      your pay two hundred and fifty dollars a month. Of course that trade
      includes your reinstatement as a licensed master and the dropping of all
      charges in the <i>Montana</i> matter. There is no indictment, and the
      witnesses will be taken care of, so that the matter will not come up,
      providing you have enemies. This is man's talk, Mayo! You'll have to admit
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's another thing which must be admitted, Fogg! I have been
      disgraced, hounded, and persecuted. The men along this coast, the most of
      them, will always believe I made a mistake. You know what that means to a
      shipmaster!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fogg wiped the moisture off his cheeks with a purple handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were put in devilish wrong. I admit it. I went too far. That's why
      Marston is making me the goat now. I shall be dumped if this matter isn't
      straightened out between us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in this very room one day, Mr. Fogg, and saw how you dumped one
      Burkett. You seemed to enjoy doing it. Why shouldn't I have a little
      enjoyment of my own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to dump him. He was a fool. He had bragged. I had to protect
      interests as well as myself. But you haven't anything to consider, right
      now, but your own profit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; inquired Mayo, sardonically. &ldquo;You seem to have me sized up
      as one of these mild and forgiving angels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, look here, Mayo, don't let any fool notions stand in the way of your
      making good. It isn't sense; it isn't business! You have something we want
      and we're willing to come across for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What other strings are hitched on?&rdquo; asked the young man, feigning
      intractability as his best resource in this puzzling affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course you give up that fool job you're working on. Quit being a
      junkman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not a junkman. We're going to float the Conomo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mayo, talk sense! That job can't be done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you've been telling every outfitter and banking-man in this city,
      Fogg! But now you are talking to a man who knows better. And let me say
      something else to you. I'll do no business with the kind of a man you have
      shown yourself to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be a boy, Mayo. I'm here with full powers. We'll take that wreck
      off your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to kill her as she stands, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's our business what we do with her after we pay our money,&rdquo; declared
      Fogg, bridling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's something more than business&mdash;business with you&mdash;in
      this matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see there is! It's your childish revenge you're looking after.
      I'll give you ten thousand dollars to divide among that bunch of paupers.
      Send them along about their fishing, and be sensible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no use for us to talk, Fogg. I see that you don't understand me at
      all. You ought to know better than to ask me to sell out myself and my
      partners.&rdquo; He rose and started for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partners&mdash;those paupers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have frozen and sweat, worked and starved, with me out on Razee
      Reef, Fogg. They are partners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's your lay? What are the writings?&rdquo; insisted the promoter, following
      Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the scratch of a pen. Only man's decency and honor. You and your boss
      haven't got money enough to buy&mdash;There isn't anything to sell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are some things we can buy, if it has come to a matter of
      blackmail,&rdquo; raged Fogg. &ldquo;Are you cheap enough to trade on a foolish girl's
      cursed butting into matters she didn't understand? You have been pawing
      those papers over. You know what they mean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo turned and looked at the excited man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have nothing to do with you or your affairs, the most of those
      papers,&rdquo; sputtered Fogg. &ldquo;Mayo, be reasonable. We can't afford to have our
      holding companies shown up. The syndicate can get by that infernal Federal
      law if we work carefully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Otherwise Marston and you and a few others might go to Atlanta, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't too late to send you there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are worrying about those papers, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I'm worrying about them! What do you suppose I'm down here
      for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You keep on worrying, Mr. Fogg! Come on into the little corner of hell
      where I have been for the last few months; the fire is fine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He yanked open the door and slammed it behind him, shutting off the
      promoter's frenzied appeals.

      XXX ~ THE MATTER OP A MONOGRAM IN WAX
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     O come list awhile and you soon shall hear.
     By the rolling sea lived a maiden fair.
     Her father followed the sum-muggling trade
               Like a warlike he-ro,
     Like a warlike he-ro that never was aff-er-aid!
                        &mdash;The Female Smuggler.
</pre>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo carried only doubts and discouragement back to the wreck on
      Razee. His doubts were mostly concerned with the matter of the documents
      which Mr. Fogg was seeking so insistently. Mayo himself had done a little
      seeking. He inquired at the post-office, but there was no mail for him. If
      no papers had been abstracted from the Marston archives, if this affair
      were some new attempt at guile on the part of Fogg, the promoter had
      certainly done a masterly bit of acting, Mayo told himself. He determined
      to keep his own counsel and wait for developments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later the developments arrived at Razee in the person of Captain
      Zoradus Wass, who came a-visiting in a chartered motor-boat. He climbed
      the ladder, greeted his <i>protégé</i> with sailor heartiness, and went on
      a leisurely tour of inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something like a tinker's job on an iron kittle, son,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;You
      must have been born with some of the instincts of a plumber. Keep on the
      way you're operating and you'll get her off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll never get her off by operating as I am just now, Captain Wass. We
      are standing still. No money, no credit, no grub. I made a raise of five
      thousand and have spent it. I don't dare to go to the old skinflint
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why not try the heiress?&rdquo; inquired the old skipper. &ldquo;You know I
      have always advised you strong about the heiress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Captain Wass, I don't want to hear any more jokes on that
      subject,&rdquo; objected the young roan, curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No joke to this,&rdquo; stated the captain, with serenity. &ldquo;Let's step into
      this stateroom.&rdquo; He led the way and locked the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no joke, son,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;and I don't like to have you show
      any tartness in the matter. Seeing what friends we have been, I ain't
      taking it very kindly because you have been so mighty close-mouthed. I'm a
      man to be trusted. You made a mistake in not telling me. The thing 'most
      fell down between me and her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He frowned reproachfully at the astonished Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She came expecting, of course, that I was about your closest friend, and
      when I had to own up that you have never mentioned her to me she thought
      she had made a mistake in me, and wasn't going to give me the thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What thing, and what are you talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Wass patted his coat pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I convinced her, and it was lucky that I was able to, for it's a matter
      where only a close and careful friend ought to be let in. But after this
      you mustn't keep any secrets away from me if you expect me to help you.
      However, you have shown that you can take good advice when I give it to
      you. I advised you to grab Julius Marston's daughter and, by thunder! you
      went and done it. Now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo impatiently interrupted. Captain Wass was drawling, with manifest
      enjoyment of the part he was taking in this romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have brought something for me, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a keen one, son,&rdquo; proceeded the captain, making no move to show
      the object he was patting. &ldquo;Hunted me up, remembering that I had you with
      me on the old <i>Nequasset</i>, and put questions to me smart, I can tell
      you! You ought to have been more confidential with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Wass, I can't stand any more of this nonsense. If you have
      anything for me, hand it over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have taken pains for you, traveled down here, four or five hundred
      miles, taking&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, taking your time for the trip and for this conversation,&rdquo; declared
      Mayo, with temper. &ldquo;I have been put in a mighty mean position by not
      knowing you had these papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe and sure has always been my motto! And I had a little business of my
      own to tend to on the way. I have been finding out how that fat Fogg
      snapped himself in as general manager of the Vose line. Of course, it was
      known well enough how he did it, but I have located the chap that done it
      for him&mdash;that critter we took along as steward, you remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his anxiety to get into his hands the parcel in the old
      skipper's pocket, Mayo listened with interest to this information; it
      related to his own affairs with Fogg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to help the honest crowd in the Vose line management to tip
      over that sale that was made, and when the right time comes I'll have that
      white-livered clerk in the witness-box if I have to lug him there by the
      ears. Now, Mayo, that girl didn't say what was in this packet.&rdquo; He pulled
      out a small parcel which had been carefully tied with cords. &ldquo;She is in
      love with you, because she must be in love to go to so much trouble in
      order to get word to you. If this is a love-letter, it's a big one. Seems
      to be all paper! I have hefted it and felt of it consid'able.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held it away from Mayo's eager reach and investigated still more with
      prodding fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope she isn't sending back your love-letters, son. But by the look she
      had on her face when she was talking about you to me I didn't reckon she
      was doing that. Well, here's comfort for you!&rdquo; He placed the packet in
      Mayo's hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parcel was sealed with three neat patches of wax, and on each blob was
      imprinted the letters &ldquo;A M&rdquo; in a monogram. Mayo turned the packet over and
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want me to step out, not feeling as confidential toward me as you
      used to, I'll do it,&rdquo; proffered Captain Wass, after a polite wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to open this thing&mdash;not yet,&rdquo; declared the young man.
      &ldquo;That's for reasons of my own&mdash;quite private ones, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'd just as soon step out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. Your being here has nothing whatever to do with the matter.&rdquo; He
      buttoned the packet into his coat pocket. He had little respect for
      Fletcher Fogg's delicacy in any question of procedure; the promoter's
      animus in the matter of those papers was clear. Nevertheless, the agent
      had crystallized in bitter words an idea which was deterring Mayo: would
      he take advantage of a girl's rash betrayal of her father? Somehow those
      seals with her monogram made sacred precincts of the inside of the packet;
      he touched them and withdrew his hand as if he were intruding at the door
      which was closed upon family privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you'd rather keep your mind wholly on straight business, seeing
      what a bad position you're in,&rdquo; suggested Captain Wass. &ldquo;Very well, we'll
      put love-letters away and talk about something that's sensible. It's too
      bad there isn't some tool we could have to pry open that Vose line
      sell-out. The stockholders got cold feet and slid out from under Vose
      after the <i>Montana</i> was laid up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has been done with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, up to now. Cashed in with the underwriters and are probably
      using the money to play checkers with on Wall Street. Maybe they're using
      her for a horrible example till they scare the rest of the independents
      into the combination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the underwriters sold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She has been bid in&mdash;probably by some tinder-strapper of the
      big pirates. It's a wonder they let you get hold of this one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They thought she was spoken for. When they found that she wasn't, they
      sent Burkett out here to blow her up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Wass was not astonished by that information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably! All the talk which has been circulated says that you were
      junking her. I didn't have any idea you were trying to save her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been blocked by some busy talkers,&rdquo; admitted the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too bad the other folks can't do some talking and have the facts to
      back 'em up, son. Do you know what could be done if that syndicate could
      be busted? The old Vose crowd would probably hitch up with the Bee line
      folks. The Bee-liners are discouraged, but they haven't let go their
      charter. You wouldn't have to worry, then, about getting your money to
      finish this job, and you'd have a blamed quick market for this steamer as
      soon as she was off this reef.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bulging packet seemed to press against Mayo's ribs, insistently
      hinting at its power to help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going back and have a talk with old man Vose about this steamer,&rdquo;
       said Captain Wass. &ldquo;Now, son, a last word. I don't want to pry into any
      delicate matters. But I sort of smell a rat in those papers in your
      pocket. When she took 'em out of her muff all I could smell was violet. Do
      you think you've got anything about you that would help me&mdash;help us&mdash;help
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; only what you see for yourself in this steamer's possibilities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; then I'll do the best I can. But confound this girl business
      when it's mixed into man's matters!&rdquo; It was heartfelt echo of Mr. Fogg's
      sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Wass departed on his chartered motor-boat, after eating some of
      the boiled fish and potatoes which made up the humble fare of the workers
      on Razee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo based no hopes on the promised intervention of the old skipper. He
      had been so thoroughly discouraged by all the callous interests on shore
      that he felt sure his project was generally considered a failure. When he
      was on shore himself the whole thing seemed to be more or less a dream.
      {*}
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * When the steamer <i>Carolyn</i> was wrecked on Metinic Rock a
     few years ago a venturesome young man, without money or
     experience in salvaging, managed to raise a few thousand
     dollars, bought the steamer for $1,000 from a frightened
     junk concern, and after many months of toil, during which he
     was mocked at by experienced men, managed to float her. She
     was sold recently for $180,000, and is now carrying cargoes
     to Europe.
</pre>
    <p>
      They were reduced to extremities on board the <i>Conomo</i>. There was no
      more coal for the lighter's engine, equipment was disabled, parts were
      needed for worn machinery, Smut-nosed Dolph was pounding Hungryman's
      tattoo on the bottom of the flour-barrel, trying to knock out enough dust
      for another batch of biscuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo had kept his promise and had not confided to Captain Candage the
      source of the loan which had enabled them to do what they had done. After
      a few days of desperate consideration Mayo sailed on the <i>Ethel and May</i>
      for Maquoit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He avoided the eyes of the villagers as much as was possible; he landed
      far down the beach from the house which was the refuge for the folks from
      Hue and Cry. In his own heart he knew the reason for this slinking
      approach: he did not want Polly Candage to see him in this plight. Her
      trust had been so absolute! Her confidence in him so supreme! In his
      mental distress he was not thinking of his rags or his physical
      unsightliness. He went straight to the store of Deacon Rowley and his
      looks startled that gentleman into some rather unscriptural ejaculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Deacon Rowley promptly recovered his presence of mind when Mayo
      solicited an additional loan. The refusal was sharp and conclusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you may as well follow your hand in the thing,&rdquo; insisted Mayo.
      &ldquo;That's why I have come to you. I hated to come, sir. I have tried all
      other means. You can see how I have worked!&rdquo; He spread his tortured hands.
      &ldquo;Come out and see for yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can see that we are going to succeed if we get more money. You
      have five thousand in the project; you can't afford to drop where you
      are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what I can afford to do. I have always said, from the first, that
      you'd never make a go of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this statement Mayo displayed true amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, confound it all, you lent us money! What do you mean by crawfishing
      in this way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Deacon Rowley was visibly embarrassed; he had dropped to this vitally
      interested party a damaging admission of his real sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that I ain't going to dump any more money in, now that you ain't
      making good! I might have believed you the first time you came. I reckon I
      must have. But you can't fool me again. No use to coax! Not another cent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you worried about how you're going to get back what you have
      already lent?&rdquo; demanded Mayo, with exasperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord will provide,&rdquo; declared Deacon Rowley, devoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man stared at this amazing creditor, worked his jaws a few
      moments wordlessly, found no speech adequate, and stamped out of the
      store. He no longer dreaded to meet Polly Candage. He felt that he needed
      to see her. He was seeking the comfort of sanity in that shore world of
      incomprehensible lunacy; he had had experience with Polly Candage's
      soothing calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came out from her little school and controlled her emotions with
      difficulty when she saw his piteous condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's walk where I can feel the comfort of green grass under my feet,&rdquo; he
      pleaded; &ldquo;that may seem real! Nothing else does!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By her matter-of-fact acceptance of him and his appearance and his mood
      she calmed him as they walked along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And even Rowley,&rdquo; he added, after his blunt confession of failure, &ldquo;he
      has just turned me down. He won't follow his five thousand with another
      cent. The old rascal deserves to be cheated if we fail. He is telling me
      that he always believed we would never make good in the job. Is he crazy,
      or am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make all allowances for Deacon Rowley,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Keep away from him.
      He is not a consoling man. But there must be some way for you, Boyd. Let
      us think! You have been keeping too close to the thing&mdash;to your work&mdash;and
      there are other places besides Limeport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's New York&mdash;and there's a way,&rdquo; he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must try every chance; it means so much to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your advice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Boyd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped and pulled the sealed packet from his coat. In the stress of
      his despair and resentment he was brutal rather than considerate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are papers in there with which I can club Julius Marston until he
      squeals. I haven't seen them, but I know well enough what they are. I can
      scare him into giving back all he has taken away from me. I can make him
      give back a lot to other folks. And from those other folks I can get money
      to finish our work on the <i>Conomo</i>. Look at the monogram on that
      seal, Polly!&rdquo; He pointed grimy finger and held the packet close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From&mdash;Miss Marston?&rdquo; she asked, tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Polly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she is helping you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she is trying to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's what a girl should do when she loves a man,&rdquo; she returned. But
      she did not look at him and her lips were white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think I ought to use her help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She evidently realized that her tone was a mere quaver of assent,
      for she repeated the word more firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But these papers are not hers, Polly. She stole them&mdash;or somebody
      stole them for her&mdash;from her own father,&rdquo; he went on, relentlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must love you very much, Boyd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They turned away from each other and gazed in opposite directions. He was
      wondering, as he had through many agonized hours, just what motive was
      influencing Alma Marston in those later days. With all his soul he wanted
      to question Polly Candage&mdash;to get the light of her woman's instinct
      on his troubled affairs; but the nature of the secret he was hiding put
      effective stopper on his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under those circumstances, no matter what kind of a sacrifice she has
      made for you, you ought to accept it, Boyd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to accept it; every impulse in me says to go in and grab. Polly,
      hell-fire is blazing inside of me. I want to tear them down&mdash;the
      whole of them. I do! You needn't jump! But if I use those papers which
      that girl has stolen from her father I'll be a dirty whelp. You know it,
      and I know it! Suppose you should tell me some secret about your own
      father so I could use it to cheat him out of his share of our partnership?
      You might mean all right, but after I had used it you would hate me! Now
      wouldn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;probably I wouldn't hate you,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;But I'd
      think more of you if you&mdash;yes, I'm sure I'd think more of you if you
      didn't take advantage of my foolishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it, exactly! Any man, if I told him about this situation, would
      say that I'm a fool not to use every tool I can get hold of. But you
      understand better! I'm glad I came to talk with you. I have been
      dreadfully tempted. Your advice is keeping me straight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not advised you, Boyd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't need to use words! It's your instinct telling me what is right
      to do. You wouldn't think it was a square deal for me to use these papers,
      would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you love her so much that you're willing to sacrifice yourself and
      your work and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it, Polly! I'm sacrificing your father, too! It's for a notion&mdash;not
      much else!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it must be because you love her so much. You are afraid she will
      think less of you if you take advantage of her. I think your stand is
      noble, Boyd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't! I think it's infernal foolishness, and I wish the Mayo breed
      didn't have so much of that cursed stiff-necked conscience! Our family
      wouldn't be where it is to-day.&rdquo; He spoke with so much heat that she
      turned-wondering eyes on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's for her sake, Boyd! It's&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the sort! That is, it isn't as you think it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only think you love her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want you to say that&mdash;or believe it!&rdquo; he raved. &ldquo;If you only
      knew&mdash;if I could tell you&mdash;you'd see that it's insulting my
      common sense to say that I'm in love with Alma Marston. I don't love her!
      I&mdash;I don't know just where I stand. I don't know what's the matter
      with me. I'm in the most damnable position a man can be in. And I'm
      talking like a fool. Isn't that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand you,&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you don't. I reckon I'm a lunatic. I'll be rolling over here
      and biting the grass next!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His passion puzzled her. His flaming eyes, his rough beard, his rage, and
      all the uncouth personality of him shocked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boyd, what&mdash;whatever is the matter? I'm afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't blame you. I'm afraid of myself these days!&rdquo; He shook his swollen
      fists over his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to encourage you because she is trying to help you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be still!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;You don't know what you're talking about. Help me!
      There are women who can help a man&mdash;do help a man, every turn he
      makes. There are other women who keep kicking him down into damnation even
      when they think they are helping. I'm not going to stay here any longer. I
      mustn't stay, Polly. I'll be saying things worse than what I have said.
      What I said about women doesn't refer to you! You are true and good, and I
      envy that man, whoever he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started down the slope toward the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going back to the wreck?&rdquo; she asked, plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the wreck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wait!&rdquo; She could not control either her feelings or her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't wait. I don't dare to stay another minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She called again and he halted at a little distance and faced her. He was
      absolutely savage in demeanor and tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember what I said about her! Don't insult my common sense! She is&mdash;Oh,
      no matter!&rdquo; He shook his fists again and went on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood on the hillside and watched him row out to the little schooner.
      And through her tears she did not know whether he waved salute to her with
      those poor, work-worn hands, or again shook his fists. He made some sort
      of a flourish over the rail of the quarter-deck. The grieving and
      mystified girl was somberly certain that his troubles had touched Mayo's
      wits.

     Will had promised his Sue that this trip, if well ended,
          Should coil up his ropes and he'd anchor on shore.
     When his pockets were lined, why his life should be mended,
          The laws he had broken he'd never break more.

    <p>
      They needed food, lease-money for their hired equipment was due, and the
      dependents at Maquoit must be looked after.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pride and hope had inspired the crew at Razee to salvage the <i>Conomo</i>
      intact. Material removed from her would immediately become junk to be
      valued at junk prices, instead of being a valuable and active asset on
      board. But there was no other resource in sight. No word came from Captain
      Wass; and Mayo had put little confidence in that possibility, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing else to do&mdash;they must sell off something on which
      they could realize quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the estimation of many practical men this procedure would have been a
      warrantable makeshift, its sole drawback being a sacrifice of values. But
      to the captains on Razee it seemed like the beginning of complete
      surrender; it was the first step toward the dismantling of the steamship.
      It was making a junk-pile of her, and they confessed to themselves that
      they would probably be obliged to keep on in the work of destruction. In
      the past their bitterest toil had been spiced with the hope of big
      achievement; the work they now set themselves to do was melancholy
      drudgery.
    </p>
    <p>
      They brought the <i>Ethel and May</i> alongside and loaded into her the
      anchors, chains, spare cables, and several of the life-boats. Mayo took
      charge of the expedition to the main.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little schooner, sagging low with her burden, wallowed up the harbor
      of Limeport just before sunset, one afternoon. Early June was abroad on
      the seas and the pioneer yachting cruisers had been coaxed to the
      eastward; Mayo saw several fine craft anchored inside the breakwater and
      paid little attention to them. He paced the narrow confines of his
      quarter-deck and felt the same kind of shame a ruined man feels when he is
      on his way to the pawnshop for the first time. He had his head down; he
      hated to look forward at the telltale cargo of the schooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By ginger! here's an old friend of yours, this yacht!&rdquo; called Mr. Speed,
      who was at the wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were making a reach across the harbor to an anchorage well up toward
      the wharves, and were passing under the stern of a big yacht. Mayo looked
      up. It was the <i>Olenia</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But excuse me for calling it a friend, Captain Mayo,&rdquo; bawled the mate,
      with open-water disregard of the possibilities of revelation in his
      far-carrying voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man rose from a chair on the yacht's quarter-deck and came to the rail.
      Though the schooner passed hardly a biscuit-toss away, the man leveled
      marine glasses, evidently to make sure that what he had guessed, after Mr.
      Speed's remark, was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo felt an impulse to turn his back, to dodge below. But he did not
      retreat; he walked to his own humble rail and scowled up into the
      countenance of Julius Mar-ston. The schooner was sluggish and the breeze
      was light, and the two men had time for a prolonged interchange of visual
      rancor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean to holler so loud, Captain Mayo,&rdquo; barked Oakum Otie, in
      still more resonant manner, to offer apology. &ldquo;But seeing her, and
      remembering last time I laid eyes on her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; commanded the master. &ldquo;I'll take the wheel. Go forward and
      clear cable, and stand by for the word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked behind, in spite of himself, and saw that a motor-tender had
      come away from the <i>Olenia</i>. It foamed along in the wake of the
      schooner. It circled her after it had passed, and kept up those manouvers
      until the schooner's anchor was let go. Then the tender came to the side
      and stopped. The mate and engineer in her were new men; Mayo did not know
      them. The mate tipped respectful salute and stated that Mr. Marston had
      sent them to bring Captain Mayo on board the yacht at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My compliments to Mr. Marston. But I am not able to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went away, but returned in a short time, and the mate handed a note
      over the rail. It was a curt statement, dictated and typewritten, that Mr.
      Marston wished to see Captain Mayo on business connected with the <i>Conomo</i>,
      and that if Captain Mayo were not able to transact that business Mr.
      Marston would be obliged to hunt up some other party who could do business
      regarding the <i>Conomo</i>. Remembering that he had the interests of
      others to consider, Mayo dropped into the tender, sullen, resentful,
      wondering what new test of his endurance was to be made, and feeling
      peculiarly ill-equipped, in his present condition of courage and temper,
      to meet Julius Marston.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter had himself under full restraint when they met on the yacht's
      quarter-deck, and Mayo was more fully conscious of his own inadequacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Below, if you please, captain.&rdquo; He led the way, even while he uttered the
      invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one was visible in the saloon. In the luxury of that interior the
      unkempt visitor seemed especially strange, particularly out of place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will excuse what has seemed to be my hurry in getting you over here,
      sir, but I take it that your sailing into this port just now coincides
      with the arrival of the Vose crowd in this city to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fletcher Fogg first, and now Mr. Fogg's employer, had given advance
      information which anticipated Mayo's knowledge. The young man had been
      having some special training in dissimulation, and he did not betray any
      surprise. He bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's better for you to talk with me before you allow them to make a fool
      of you. I am prepared to take that steamer off your hands, as she stands,
      at a fair appraisal, and I will give bonds to assume all expenses of the
      suit brought by the underwriters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There has been no suit brought by the underwriters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Marston raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;Oh! I must remember that you are
      considerably out of the world. The underwriters make claim that the vessel
      was not legally surrendered by them. Have you documents showing release?
      If so, I'll be willing to pay you about double what otherwise I shall feel
      like offering. Take a disputed title in an admiralty case and it's touchy
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo remembered the haphazard manner in which the steamer had been
      transferred, and he did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marston's manner was that of calm, collected, cool business; his air
      carried weight. More than ever did Mayo feel his own pitiful weakness in
      these big affairs where more than honest hard work counted in the final
      adjustment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much did you pay your big lawyers to stir up this suit by the
      underwriters?&rdquo; he blurted, and Marston's eyelids flicked, in spite of his
      impassivity. There was instinct of the animal at bay, rather than any
      knowledge, behind Mayo's question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you suggest that I have anything to do with such a suit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem almighty ready to assume all liability.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not here to have childish disputes with you, sir. This is straight
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you documents, as I have suggested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my bill of sale. I take it for granted that the folks who sold to
      me are backed by papers from the underwriters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's where you are in error, unfortunately. You are all made party to a
      suit. Time clause, actual abandonment, right of redemption&mdash;all those
      matters are concerned. Of course, it means injunction and long litigation.
      I suggested assuming liabilities and stepping in, because I am backed by
      the best admiralty lawyers in New York. I repeat the offer Mr. Fogg made
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You admit that Mr. Fogg made that offer for you or your interests, do
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes!&rdquo; admitted Marston. &ldquo;We allow Mr. Fogg to act for us in a few
      matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to know it. There has been so much cross-tag going on that I
      have been a little doubtful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kindly avoid sarcasm and temper, if you please! Do you care to accept the
      offer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo glared at the financier, looking him up and down. Furious hatred took
      away his power of sane consideration. He was in no mood to weigh chances,
      either for himself or for his associates. He doubted Marston's honesty of
      purpose. He knew how this man must feel toward the presumptuous fool who
      had dared to look up at Alma Marston; he was conscious that the magnate
      must be concealing some especial motive under his cold exterior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Marston was anticipating blackmail from Mayo's possession of the
      documents or had hatched up ostensible litigation in order to force the
      bothersome amateurs out of the <i>Conomo</i> proposition, the young man
      could not determine; either view of the situation was equally insulting to
      those whom he made his antagonists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; snapped the magnate, plainly finding it difficult to restrain his
      own violent hatred much longer in this interview. &ldquo;Decide whether you will
      have a little ready cash and a good position or whether you will be kicked
      out entirely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want your money! You're trying to cheat me with fake law business
      even while you are offering me money! I don't want your job! I have worked
      for you once. I'll never be your hired man again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did not know that you have a better reason for standing out in this
      fashion, I'd say that you have allowed, your spite to drive you crazy,
      young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that better reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blackmail! You propose to trade on a theft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo struggled for a moment with an impulse that was almost frantic; he
      wanted to throw the packet in Mar-ston's face and tell him that he lied.
      Again the young man felt that queer sense of helplessness; he knew that he
      could not make Marston understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mayo, I have tried to deal with you as if you were more or less of a man.
      I was willing to admit that my agents had injured you by their mistakes. I
      have offered a decent compromise. I have done what I hardly ever do&mdash;bother
      with petty details like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That impulse to deliver the papers to Marston was then not so insistent;
      even Mayo's rising anger did not prompt him to do that. The wreck of a
      man's life and hopes dismissed flippantly as petty details!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing that I am not able to deal with you on a business man's basis, I
      shall handle you as I would handle any other thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayo turned to leave, afraid of his own desperate desire to beat that
      sneering mouth into shapelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of the companionway stood half a dozen sailors, armed with
      iron grate-bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If those papers are on you, I'm going to have them,&rdquo; stated the
      financier. &ldquo;If they are not on you, you'll be glad to tell me where they
      are before I get done with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captive halted between the master and the vassals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to crucify my feelings a little more, Mayo,&rdquo; stated Marston.
      &ldquo;Step forward here where those men can't hear. It's important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marston knocked softly on a stateroom door and his daughter came forth.
      She gasped when she saw this ragged visitor, and in her stare there was
      real horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't been able to sift this thing to the bottom. By facing you two,
      as I'm doing, I may be able to get the truth of the case,&rdquo; said Marston,
      with the air of a magistrate dealing with malefactors. &ldquo;Now, Alma, I'll
      allow you a minute or two to use your tongue on this fine specimen before
      my men use their bars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard what my father offered you. You must take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have other men to consider&mdash;honest men, who have worked hard with
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He trembled in their presence. Her appearance put sane thoughts out of his
      head and choked the words in his throat. He saw himself in a mirror and
      wondered if this were not a dream&mdash;if it had not been a dream that
      she had ever loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to put out to her his mutilated hands which he was hiding behind
      him. He yearned to explain to her the man's side of the case. He wanted
      her to understand what he owed to the men who had risked their lives to
      serve him, to make her realize the bond which exists between men who have
      toiled and starved together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have yourself to consider, first of all. Much depends. In your silly
      notions about a lot of paupers you are throwing my father's kindness in
      his face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stammered, unable to frame coherent reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be sensible. You have no right to put a heap of scrap-iron and a lot of
      low creatures ahead of your personal interests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was malice in Marston's eyes. He saw an opportunity to make Mayo's
      position even more false in the opinion of the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be entirely frank, Mayo. In spite of our personal differences, I
      want your services&mdash;I need them. I have found out that you're a young
      man of determination and plenty of ability. I'll put you ahead fast if
      you'll come over with me. But you must come clean. No strings on you with
      that other crowd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't sell 'em out. I won't do it,&rdquo; protested Mayo. He did not exactly
      understand all the reasons for his obstinacy. But his instinct told him
      that Julius Marston was not descending in this manner except for powerful
      reasons, and that he was attempting to buy a traitor for his uses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you dare to turn against my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don't know! Something seems to be the matter with me.&rdquo; He
      wrenched at his throat with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after what I did&mdash;my wicked foolishness&mdash;those papers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on! I propose to get to the bottom of this thing,&rdquo; declared Marston.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man drove his hand into his pocket, pulled out the sealed
      packet, and forced it into the girl's hands. Marston promptly seized it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not opened it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not open it, either,&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;I sealed it, just as it was
      tied up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marston ripped off the strings and the wax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside a loud voice was hailing the yacht. &ldquo;Compliments of Captain Wass
      to Captain Mayo, and will he please say when he is coming back aboard his
      schooner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The financier paid no attention; he was busy with the papers. His face was
      white with rage. He threw them about him on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every sheet is blank&mdash;it is waste-paper!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;What
      confounded trick is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better ask the man who gave that packet to your daughter,&rdquo;
       suggested Mayo. He seemed to be less astonished than Marston and the girl.
      &ldquo;I might have known that your man, Bradish, would be that kind of a
      sneak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about Bradish being concerned in this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm guessing it. Probably your daughter can say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have no more of your evasions, Alma. I'm going to the bottom of this
      matter now. Did Bradish give you this packet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did it get to this man here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave it to a man named Captain Wass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again they heard the voice outside. &ldquo;I don't care if he is busy! I tell
      you to take word to Captain Mayo that he is wanted right away on his
      schooner. Tell him it's Captain Wass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil has sent that man along at about the right time,&rdquo; declared
      Marston. He strode to the companion-way. &ldquo;Inform Captain Wass that he is
      wanted on board here! Hide those bars till he is below!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came back, raging, and stood between Mayo and the girl, who had seemed
      to find words inadequate during the short time they had been left
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe anything you tell me! There's an infernal trick, here.
      The papers are missing. Somebody has them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His fury blinded his prudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He strode toward Captain Wass when the old mariner came stumping down the
      companionway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your name Wass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Wass, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You took papers from my daughter and brought them to this man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Correct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marston stepped back and kicked at the blank sheets on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you can tell me if these are what you brought.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Wass stared long at Mayo, at the girl, and at the incensed
      magnate. Then he looked down at the scattered papers and scratched his
      head with much deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you say something?&rdquo; demanded Marston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm naturally slow and cautious,&rdquo; stated Captain Wass. He put on his
      spectacles, kneeled on the soft carpet, and examined the blank papers and
      the broken seals. He laid them back on the carpet and meditated for some
      time, still on his knees. When he looked up, peering over the edge of his
      spectacles, he paid no attention to Mar-ston, to the latter's indignant
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vose and others are waiting for us at the hotel,&rdquo; he informed Captain
      Mayo, &ldquo;and it's important business, and we'd better be tending to it
      instead of fooling around here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter about any other business except this, sir,&rdquo; cried Marston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can't be much business mixed up in a lot of blank sheets of paper,&rdquo;
       snapped Captain Wass. &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lost valuable papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old skipper bent shrewd squint at the angry man who was standing over
      him. &ldquo;Steamer combination papers, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to know pretty well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ought to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Wass rose slowly, with grunts, and rubbed his stiff knees.
      &ldquo;Because I've got 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stole them from the package, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't stealing&mdash;it was business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hand them over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insist on that, too, Captain Wass,&rdquo; said Mayo, with indignation. &ldquo;Hand
      over those papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't be done, for I haven't got 'em with me. And I won't hand 'em over
      till I have used them in my business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have you arrested,&rdquo; announced Marston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do. Sooner the whole thing gets before the court, the better.&rdquo; His
      perfect calmness had its effect on the financier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you proposing to use those papers for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make you pirates turn back the Vose line property and pay damages. As
      to the rest of your combination, the critters that's in it can skin their
      own skunks. I guess the whole thing will take care of itself after we get
      the Vose line back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are asking for an impossibility. The matter cannot be arranged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we'll see how far Uncle Sam can go in unscrambling that particular
      nestful of eggs. I'll give the papers to the government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you any influence with this man?&rdquo; Marston asked the astounded
      Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he hasn't&mdash;not a mite in this case,&rdquo; returned Captain Wass. &ldquo;He
      needs a guardeen in some things, and I'm serving as one just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must get them from him&mdash;you must, Captain Mayo,&rdquo; cried the girl.
      &ldquo;I did not understand what I was doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will get them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to see you do it, son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned on the Wall Street man. &ldquo;I'm only asking for what is rightfully
      due my own people. I'm a man of few words and just now I'm sticking close
      to schedule. Until eleven o'clock to-night you'll find Vose, myself, and
      our lawyers at the Nicholas Hotel. After eleven o'clock we shall be in bed
      because we've got to get an early start for the wreck out on Razee. We're
      going to finance that job. And in case we don't come to terms with you
      tonight we shall use our club to keep you out of our business after this.
      You know what the club is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marston was too busily engaged with Captain Wass to pay heed to his
      daughter. She went close to Mayo and whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must quit them, Boyd. It's for my sake. You must help my father. They
      are wretches. Think of what it will mean to you if you can help us! You
      will do it. Promise me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dare to hesitate for one moment&mdash;when I ask you&mdash;for my
      sake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's my last word,&rdquo; bawled Captain Wass. &ldquo;There's no blackmail about it&mdash;we're
      only taking back what's our own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you one of those&mdash;creatures?&rdquo; she asked, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had shown one spark of sympathy or real understanding in that
      crisis of their affairs, if she had not been so much, in that moment, the
      daughter of Julius Marston, counseling selfishness, he might have
      fatuously continued to coddle his romance, in spite of all that had
      preceded. But her eyes were hard. Her voice had the money-chink in it. He
      started, like a man awakened. His old cap had fallen on the carpet. He
      picked it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have found out where I belong in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in that unheroic fashion ended something which, so he then realized,
      should never have been begun. He followed Captain Wass across the saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better advise your buckos to be careful how they handle them grate-bars,&rdquo;
       shouted Captain Wass. &ldquo;I'm loaded, and if I'm joggled I'm liable to
      explode.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were not molested when they left the yacht. The doryman who had
      brought Captain Wass rowed them to the wharf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those papers&mdash;&rdquo; Mayo had ventured, soon after they left the yacht's
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one word about 'em!&rdquo; yelped the old skipper. &ldquo;It's my business&mdash;entire!
      When the time comes right I'll show you that it's my private business. I
      never allow anybody to interfere in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night, after the conference at the hotel, and after Julius Marston,
      growling profanity, had put his name to certain papers, drawn by careful
      lawyers, Captain Wass explained why the matter of the sealed packet was
      his private business. He took Marston apart from the others for the
      purpose of explaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't said one word to Vose or his associates about this business of
      the documents. They think you have come because you wanted to straighten
      out a low-down trick worked by an understrapper. So this has put you in
      mighty well with the Vose crowd, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marston grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to be kind of pleasing to have a few men think you are on the
      square,&rdquo; pursued Captain Wass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's enough of this pillycock conversation. Hand over those papers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just one moment!&rdquo; He signaled to Captain Mayo, who came to them. &ldquo;I'm
      going to tell Mr. Marston why those documents were my especial business
      to-day, and why you couldn't control me in the matter. I may as well
      explain to the two of you at once. It was my own business for this reason:
      I don't know anything about any papers. I never saw any. I never opened
      that package. I handed it along just as it was given to me. That's true,
      on my sacred word, Mr. Marston; and I haven't any reason for lying to you&mdash;not
      after you have signed those agreements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come outside,&rdquo; urged the financier. &ldquo;I want to tell you what I think of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the old skipper, mildly. &ldquo;And I'd lower your voice, sir, if I
      were you. These men here have a pretty good idea of you just now, and I
      don't want you to spoil it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a lying renegade!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! I have only showed you that all the good bluffers are not confined
      to Wall Street. There's one still loose there. Your man Bradish probably
      had reasons for wanting to bluff your daughter&mdash;and save his own
      skin. He'll probably hand your papers to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marston swore and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I laid out that course whilst I was down on my knees in his cabin, sort
      of praying for a good lie in a time of desp'rit need,&rdquo; Captain Wass
      confided to Mayo. &ldquo;It wasn't bad, considering the way it has worked out.&rdquo;

    <p>
      There was no niggardliness in the trade the Vose folks made with Captain
      Mayo. They contracted to co-operate with him and his men in floating the
      steamship, repairing her in dry dock, and refitting her for her route. She
      would be appraised as she stood after refitting, as a going proposition,
      and Mayo was to receive stock to the amount of her value&mdash;stock in
      the newly organized Vose line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Furthermore,&rdquo; stated old man Vose, &ldquo;we shall need a chap of just about
      your gauge as manager. You have shown that you are able to do things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was up on the <i>Conomo's</i> deck after a long inspection of the work
      which had been done under difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have had this steamer off with your own efforts if your money
      had lasted. Your next job is the <i>Montana</i>; but you'll simply manage
      that, Captain Mayo&mdash;use your head and save your muscle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll get her off, seeing that I put her on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all know just how she was put on&mdash;and Marston will pay for it in
      his hard coin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under these circumstances Razee Reef was no longer a mourners' bench! The
      dreary days of makeshift were at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lighters of one of the biggest wrecking companies of the coast hurried
      to Razee and flocked around the maimed steamer&mdash;Samaritans of the
      sea. Gigantic equipment embraced her; great pumps gulped the water from
      her; bolstered and supported, as a stricken man limps with his arms across
      the shoulders of his friends, the steamer came off Razee Reef with the
      first spring tide in July, and toiled off across the sea in the wake of
      puffing tugs, and was shored up and safe at last in a dry dock&mdash;the
      hospital of the crippled giants of the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      No music ever sounded as sweet to Captain Mayo as that clanging chorus the
      hammers of the iron-workers played on the flanks of the <i>Conomo</i>. But
      he tore himself away from that music, and went down to Maquoit along with
      a vastly contented Captain Candage, who remembered now that he had a
      daughter waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been apprised by letter of their success and of their coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maquoit made a celebration of that arrival of the <i>Ethel and May</i>,
      and Dolph and Otie, cook and mate of the schooner, led the parade when the
      men were on shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came back to their own with the full purses that the generosity of
      their employers had provided, and there was no longer any doubt as to the
      future of the men who once starved on Hue and Cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo had declared that he knew where to find faithful workers when
      it came time to distribute jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polly Candage had come to him when he stepped foot on shore, hands
      outstretched to him, and eyes alight. And when she put her hands in his he
      knew, in his soul, that this was the greeting he had been waiting for; her
      words of congratulation were the dearest of all, her smile was the best
      reward, and for her dear self he had been hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he would not admit to himself that he had come to woo.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the soft dusk had softened the harsh outlines of the little hamlet,
      and the others were busy with their own affairs and had left Mayo and
      Polly to themselves, he sat with her on the porch of the widow's cottage,
      where they spent that first evening after they had been saved from the
      sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a long silence between them. &ldquo;We have had no opportunity&mdash;I
      have not dared yet to tell you my best hopes for the dearest thing of
      all,&rdquo; she ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one up inland. I know. I am glad for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What one up inland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That young man&mdash;the only young man in all the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! I had forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her. &ldquo;Forgotten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;I don't exactly mean forgotten. But I was not
      thinking about him when I spoke. I mean that now&mdash;with your new
      prospects&mdash;you can go to&mdash;to&mdash;There may come a time when
      you can speak to Mr. Marston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have spoken to Mr. Marston, quite lately. He has spoken to me,&rdquo; he
      said, his face hard. &ldquo;We shall never speak to each other again, if I can
      have my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He met her astonished gaze. &ldquo;Polly, I hate to trouble you with my poor
      affairs of this kind. I can talk of business to Mr. Vose, and of the sea
      to your father. But there's another matter that I can't mention to anybody&mdash;except
      you will listen. I will tell you where I saw Mr. Marston&mdash;and his
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She listened, her lips apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, you see,&rdquo; he said at the end, &ldquo;it was worse than a dream; it was a
      mistake. It couldn't have been real love, for it was not built on the
      right foundation. I have never had much experience with girls. I have been
      swashing about at sea 'most all my life. Perhaps I don't know what real
      love is. But it seems to me it can't amount to much unless it is built up
      on mutual understanding, willingness to sacrifice for each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; returned Polly, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see that young man of yours, up inland. I want to tell him that
      he is mighty lucky because he met you first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell you just why. It isn't right for me to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a girl likes to hear such things. Please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you forgive me for saying what I shouldn't say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will forgive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's lucky, because if I didn't know you were promised and in love, I'd
      go down at your feet and beg you to marry me. You're the wife for a Yankee
      sailor, Polly Candage. If only there were two of you in this world, we'd
      have a double wedding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaped up and started away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; she asked, and there was almost a wail in her
      tones. &ldquo;No, he does not understand girls well,&rdquo; she told herself,
      bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going down to Rowley's store to see if he will take his money back
      and let us save interest. He told me I'd have to keep the money for a
      year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She called to him falteringly, but with such appeal in her tones that he
      halted and stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't you&mdash;Isn't it just as well to let the matter rest until&mdash;till&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there's no time like the present in money matters,&rdquo; he declared, with
      a laugh, wholly oblivious, not in the least understanding her
      embarrassment, her piteous effort to bar her little temple of love's
      sacrifice so that he could not trample in just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      His laugh was a forced one. He realized that if he did not hurry away from
      this girl he would be reaching out his arms to her, declaring the love
      that surged in him, now that he had awakened to full consciousness of that
      love; his Yankee reticence, his instinct of honor between men, were
      fighting hard against his passion; he told himself that he would not
      betray a man he did not know, nor proffer love to a girl who, so he
      believed, loved another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I not go with you?&rdquo; she pleaded, restraining her wild impulse to run
      ahead of him and warn the deacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; he consented, and they walked down the street, neither daring
      to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found Rowley alone in his store. He was puttering around, making
      ready to close the place for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they entered, the girl stepped behind Mayo and, catching the deacon's
      eye, made frantic gestures. In the half gloom those gestures were
      decidedly incomprehensible; the deacon lowered his spectacles and stared
      at her, trying to understand this wigwagging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to take up that loan and save the rest of the year's interest,
      Deacon Rowley,&rdquo; stated Mayo, with sailorly bluntness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was trying to convey to the deacon the fact that he must not
      reveal her secret. She was shaking her head. This seemed to the
      intermediary like direct and conclusive orders from the principal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, Captain Mayo! It can't be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't call that a square deal between men, no matter what straight
      business may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Polly now signaled eager assent, meaning to make the deacon understand
      that he must take the money. But the deacon did not understand; he thought
      the girl affirmed her desire for straight business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You took it for a year. No back tracks, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir! Keep it, as you agreed, and pay your interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deacon Rowley, you're an old idiot!&rdquo; blazed the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the deacon yanked off his spectacles, and Captain Mayo turned amazed
      eyes to her, she put her hands to her face and ran out of the store,
      sobbing. She was only a girl! She had no more resources left with which to
      meet that situation in men's affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayo's impulse was to follow, but the deacon checked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't going to be made a fool of no longer in this, even to make three
      hundred dollars,&rdquo; he rasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fool! What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go settle it with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has Polly Candage got to do with this business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's her money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She drawed her money out of the bank, and horn-swoggled me into lying for
      her. What won't a girl do when she's in love with a fellow? If you 'ain't
      knowed it before, it's high time you did know it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That last remark of the deacon's had disgusted reference only to the
      matter of the money. But it conveyed something else to Captain Boyd Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran out of the store!
    </p>
    <p>
      Far up the road he overtook her. She was hurrying home. When she faced him
      he saw tears on her cheeks, though the generous gloom of evening wrapped
      them where they stood. He took both her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Polly Candage, why did you risk your money on me?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would succeed!&rdquo; she murmured, turning her face away. &ldquo;It was
      an&mdash;a good investment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you gave it, did you&mdash;Were you thinking&mdash;Was it only for
      an investment, Polly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here! This last thing ought to tie my tongue, for I owe everything
      to you. But my tongue won't stay tied&mdash;not now, Polly. I don't care
      if there is somebody else up-country. I ought to care. I ought to respect
      your&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pulled a hand free and put plump fingers on his lips. &ldquo;There is nobody
      up-country; there never has been anybody, Boyd,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her in his arms, and kissed her, and held her close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell me one thing, now? I know the answer, sweetheart mine, but
      I want to hear you say it. Why did you give me all your money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her palms against his cheeks and spoke the words his soul was
      hungry for:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      THE END <br /><br />
